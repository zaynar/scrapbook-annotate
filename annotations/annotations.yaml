        # SEVEN STEPS TO SPACE

        BY STEVENSON PUGH

        It all began on October 4,
        1957, when the world
        heard for the first time the
        eerie bleep, bleep of a man-made
        object in space---the
        Russians' triumphant Sputnik
        I.

        Since then the Soviets have
        made no secret of their determination
        to put a man in
        space. Today we can see step
        by step how they set about it.

        Sputnik I was followed in a
        month by a second satellite
        carrying a living creature, the
        dog Laika---the first pioneer
        paving the way for Yuri
        Gagarin, and the first casualty
        of the space age.

        But before Laika died she
        proved that a living creature
        with organs not unlike those
        of a man could survive in space.

        Laika's heart, ticking on and
        bleeping back to earth until
        the oxygen and the batteries
        ran out, gave the all-clear to the
        Soviet Government to start
        pouring in the roubles and
        scientific manpower to win the
        greatest race in history.

        Even Sputnik III which followed
        Laika seven months later
        was part of the plan. Described
        as a space laboratory it was in
        fact primarily concerned with
        measuring radiation which
        might be deadly to man, even
        after his safe return.

        But the next step took far,
        far longer. The problem was
        not posed by the rockets, for
        they proved their accuracy and
        power time and again.

        It was that of getting an
        object back from space and the
        solution was not within sight
        for two years---until May 15
        last year. Then the attempt
        failed.

        The Americans actually beat
        the Russians to the first
        satellite recovery. It was a
        victory that did not last long,
        for on August 19 last year the
        first living creatures in the
        famous Zoonik returned safely
        from orbit.

        Finally, last December, the
        two dogs Strelka and Belka went
        out and came back. They went
        in a prototype capsule of the
        type that carried the first spaceman
        safely round yesterday.

        We now know that the
        Russians have in fact sent up
        five of these capsules before the
        manned one. Three were completely
        successful.

        What went wrong with the
        other two? Scientists believe
        that the answer lies in the
        mystery Sputnik VII launched
        on February 4 this year.

        The Russians said that it was
        measuring orbital orientation---in
        other words it was a trial of
        the finest possible accuracy
        that could be achieved in putting
        a spaceship in an exact
        orbit round the earth.

        Sputnik VII was the final
        guarantee of a safe flight and
        a return ticket to an exact spot
        on earth.

        Russia's ability to put a man
        up in a satellite easily and
        accurately is now held by most
        defence experts to be of the
        greatest military significance.

        A man in a space bomber
        adds the elements of choice
        and control. In a time of crisis
        orbiting H-bombers could attack
        by personal order instead of by
        robot control.

        Such a weapon would be
        even more unstoppable than the
        U.S. Polaris submarines.

        Russia's Journey to the
        stars probably started in
        1945, when the Soviet forces
        sweeping through Eastern
        Germany captured many of
        Germany's brilliant rocket
        scientists.

        The scientists were taken
        to Russia, where they laid
        the foundation for the Soviet
        Union's development of a
        massive booster for inter-continental
        ballistic missiles.
        This started in 1947.

        Ever since, Russia has been
        beating the rest of the world to
        the punch in the space race:

        OCTOBER 4. 1957. --- Sputnik I.
        It was rocketed to a maximum
        height of 588 miles, and "lived"
        for 92 days.

        NOVEMBER 3, 1957.---Sputnik II.
        Carried the first living animal
        in space, the dog Laika. The dog
        was not recovered.

        MAY 15, 1958, --- Sputnik III.
        It came down almost two years
        later In April, 1960, and was
        packed with instruments,

        JANUARY 2. 1959.---Lunik I. Just
        missed the moon, and is now in
        orbit round the sun. It is estimated
        that its life is millions
        of years.

        SEPTEMBER 12, 1959,---Lunik II.
        Landed on the moon on September
        13. The first man-made
        object to reach the moon.

        OCTOBER 4. 1959. --- Lunik III.
        Circled the moon, sent back the
        first pictures of the other side
        of the moon, and landed on
        earth again.

        MAY 15. 1960. --- Sputnik IV.
        became Spaceship I. In orbit
        round the earth, with dummy
        man.

        AUGUST 19, 1960.---Spaceship II.
        Two dogs, Strelka and Belka,
        brought back alive after orbit
        in space.

        DECEMBER 1, 1960. --- Spaceship
        III. Burned out on re-entering
        atmosphere. Two dogs destroyed.

        FEBRUARY 4, 1961.---Sputnik VII.
        Six and a half tons, in orbit.

        FEBRUARY 12, 1961. --- Venus I.
        Space probe on journey to
        Venus.

        MARCH 9. 1961. --- Spaceship IV.
        Dog "Blackie" sent into earth
        orbit and recovered alive.
        Landed at a pre-determined spot
        in Russia.

        # GOODBYE EARTH...

        SPACEMAN Yuri Gagarin is just a few moments
        from man's greatest adventure.

        Soon he will be rocketing into the unknown at
        18,000 miles an hour---breaking the barriers of space.

        This is the moment scientists had planned for. At a
        rocket site somewhere in Russia the order that opens a
        new era in history has been given.

        Major Gagarin has climbed the iron staircase that leads
        to his space capsule, now he turns to wave goodbye to
        some of the colleagues and technicians who made his
        journey possible.

        And this picture, released from Moscow yesterday,
        shows Gagarin, in space suit and helmet, raising both
        arms in a spaceman's farewell to earth.

        MOSCOW (AP) --- The world's
        first spaceman described here how
        it really fells to be in a state of
        "weightlessness."

        In an interview published by
        Izvestia, Yuri Gagarin said, "When
        weightlessness appeared I felt
        quite well. Everything became easier."

        "This is quite natural," he commented.
        "One's legs, arms weigh
        nothing, objects float in the cabin.
        Neither did I myself sit in the
        chair as I did before that, but
        hung in midair. While in the state
        of weightlessness, I ate and drank
        and everything occurred just as it
        does here on earth.

        "I even worked in that condition,
        wrote, jotting down my observations.
        My handwriting did not
        change although the hand does not
        weigh anything. Only, I had to
        hold the notebook, otherwise it
        would float away. I maintained
        communications over different
        channels and tapped the telegraph
        key."

        Tass distributed the interview
        in the Russian language under a
        Moscow dateline without saying
        where it was conducted. Gagarin,
        27-year-old major in the Soviet air
        force, returned to earth obviously
        in an area some distance from the
        capital and as yet undisclosed.

        (Gagarin was promoted from
        first lieutenant to major only a
        few moments before he boarded
        his ship for man's first venture
        into space, the official news
        agency Tass said, UPI reported.)

        The entire flight, he asserted,
        was "work" all the way.

        Even so, he said, he felt "excellent"
        during that period of his 108-minute
        flight round the world
        from 100 to 188 miles high Wednesday.

        Describing the transition from
        weightlessness back to normality,
        Gagarin said it "takes place slowly,
        step by step, smoothly. Arms and
        legs feel as they felt before the
        state of weightlessness but they
        gained weight."

        Gagarin then told how the night
        and dayside of the earth looked
        from space.

        "The dayside of the earth is
        seen quite well," he replied.

        "It is easy to distinguish the
        shores of continents, islands, big
        rivers and large reservoirs.

        "During the flight, I succeeded
        for first time in seeing with my
        own eyes the ball shape form of the
        earth. It seems like that when you
        look at the horizon. I must say that
        the view of the horizon is unusual
        and very beautiful.

        "It is possible to see the remarkably
        colorful change from the light
        surface of the earth to the completely
        black sky in which one can
        see the stars.

        "This dividing line (from light
        surface to black) is very thin, just
        like a belt of film surrounding the
        earth's sphere. This belt is like a
        narrow belt girdling the globe. It is
        of soft light blue color, and the
        entire transition from blue to black
        is most smooth and beautiful.

        "It is even hard to put into
        words. When I emerged from the
        earth shadow the horizon seemed
        different. It now had a bright
        orange strip which then resolved
        itself into blue, and again into
        pitch black."

        "I could have stayed considerably
        longer in the space ship but the
        length of my flight was determined
        by a special program. I worked well
        in the spaceship, felt well and my
        morale was excellent. I could have
        stayed in the cosmic ship as long
        as it would have been necessary
        for fulfilling the task."

        Gagarin, father of two daughters,
        told Tass he had "wanted to become
        a cosmonaut" for some time.

        What struck him most remarkably,
        he added, was how near the
        earth seemed even from the fantastic
        height of his space flight.

        "I did not see the moon," Gagarin
        continued. "The sun in outer space
        is tens of times brighter than here
        on earth. The stars are visible very
        well. They are bright and distinct.
        The entire picture of the firmament
        is much more contrasty than when
        seen from the earth."

        Radio Moscow disclosed later that
        Gagarin would be arriving in the
        capital Friday from his space station
        for a tremendous celebration.

        The radio went to unusual lengths
        to say it would broadcast happenings
        at the celebration.

        MAJOR GAGARIN'S training
        for space flight was
        described in the Moscow
        Literary Gazette yesterday by
        Professor Vasily Parin.

        The professor said that the
        major was whirled around at terrific
        speed in a giant centrifuge and
        vibrated violently on special stands.
        He practised eating and drinking
        by squeezing water and jelly-like
        "space-food" from tubes into his
        mouth.

        A correspondent of Komsomolskaya
        Pravda reported that Major
        Gagarin sang a patriotic song, "The
        Motherland hears, the Motherland
        knows where her son is flying in the
        clouds," as he floated back to earth
        suspended from huge red and white
        parachute.

        ## 'In love with you'

        The report said that during the
        flight, music was relayed to him from
        the rocket control base, and interrupted
        only by instructions and "a
        suggestion that I should have a bite."

        While waiting for blast-off, it is
        reported he listened to the song "I
        am in love with you" played from a
        tape-recorder at the launching
        ground.

        The woman collective farm
        worker, Mrs. Anna Akimovna
        Takhtarovana, who saw the major's
        descent to earth, said she had been
        wrongly described as 35 years old.
        She was 47, and the little girl with
        her was her grand-daughter.

        Major Gagarin had landed in a
        newly ploughed field, and "called to
        us in a friendly way." He was
        dressed in red and said, "I am a
        Soviet man." She added: "We
        shook hands and I invited him to a
        drink of milk."

        # Special food

        Standing in front of a huge
        white bust of Lenin, Gagarin
        told how he ate special foods
        prepared by the Academy of
        Medical Sciences.

        He did not say what type of
        food. but added: "I had no
        particular hunger or thirst---I
        ate at the same times as I
        would on the ground. The sensations
        were just about the
        same."

        Asked about his landing technique,
        Major Gagarin said:
        "Many techniques of landing
        have been developed in our
        country. One of them was the
        parachute technique.

        "In this flight we employed
        the following system: The
        pilot was in the cabin of the
        space ship. The landing proceeded
        successfully and demonstrated
        the success evolved for
        landing systems in our
        country."

        Professor Vassily Parin, of the
        Soviet Academy of Medicine,
        told the conference that, apart
        from Gagarin's own report, doctors
        were able to observe his
        condition continuously by telemetry.

        Transmitters incorporated in
        Gagarin's space suit enabled
        them to keep track of his
        physiological condition.

        SPACE NOTE: Reaching
        Mars at the rate he circled the
        world would take Yuri Gagarin
        at least ten weeks.

        # YURI'S PICTURES GIVEN AWAY

        Coloured picture postcards of
        spaceman Yuri Gagarin were

        The musical emphasis in
        reports of the flight is striking---popular
        songs before take-off, music-while-you-orbit,
        and patriotic songs
        during descent.

        The American astronauts will be
        pretty fully occupied with their
        instruments and scientific tasks
        during their flight, and, it seems, will
        be unlikely to have time, as Major
        Gagarin did, to float about their
        cabin and sing.

        However, there have often been
        oddities about the Russian approach
        to such matters.

        It would not be surprising to learn
        that the major's space seat was
        covered with red velvet, and that the
        cabin contained, besides instruments,
        a tiny aspidistra in a pot.

        # Space research switch?

        OFFICIAL reports, technical
        papers and informal comments
        by Soviet delegates at the
        International Space Science Symposium,
        which ended here to-day,
        indicate that Russia will now put
        more emphasis on gathering
        scientific data.

        There will be no rush of men into
        space. Having placed a man in orbit
        before the Americans, the Russians
        have made their point. Repetitions
        would make neither scientific sense
        nor an acceptable propaganda risk.
        A stabilised satellite carrying astronomical
        telescopes will soon be
        developed. Communications satellites
        are not on the Soviet priority
        list, although the United States has
        begun experiments on this type. The
        Russians also appear uninterested at
        present in satellites for navigation or
        for weather forecasting. There will
        be more deep-space probes and more
        ambitious manned space flights.
        Manned flight to the moon and back
        may be achieved within the next 10
        years.

        # 'The sky is dark.. the Earth is blue'

        THE Voice From Space
        said yesterday: "The
        sky is very, very dark, and
        the Earth is a light blue.
        Everything can be seen very
        clearly."

        It was the voice of Yuri
        Alexeyevitch Gagarin, the young
        Russian who, a few minutes before,
        had been hurled skywards
        into the greatest adventure ever
        undertaken by Man.

        Out in Space, at a height of 125 miles,
        whirling round the world at five miles a
        second, Gagarin talked by radio to his
        base in Russia about what he saw on a
        television screen in his Spaceship.

        ## THE UNKNOWN

        And from him, for the first time, the world
        learned what it feels like to be a man out in
        boundless Space . . . alone in a great emptiness
        where no man had been before.

        Gagarin---whose name means the Wild Duck---was
        in a Spaceship weighing 3¾ tons.

        He was strapped on a couch . . . surrounded
        by a double wall of metal that
        protected him from radiation and the battering
        of meteorites.

        He had undergone gruelling tests. The type
        of Spaceship in which he travelled had been
        tested, too--- on five unmanned Space probes.

        But, for all the tests, Gagarin was facing
        the unknown. . . .

        This is the 108-minute drama of how
        Gagarin, the Wild Duck, the family man, the
        fearless, conquered Space.

        7.7 a.m. (British Summer Time).
        Gagarin's Spaceship was
        blasted up from its Russian base, High . . .
        high . . . high. OUT of the earth's atmosphere . . .
        OUT into Space . . . into the
        curve that would take It circling the globe.

        7.22 a.m. Over SOUTH AMERICA---and
        the Spaceman reported: "The
        flight is continuing OK. I feel well."

        8.15 a.m. Over AFRICA, and another
        message: "Flight normal. I
        am withstanding well the state of weightlessness."

        8.25 a.m. Moscow Radio reported that
        braking device had been
        brought into action and the Spaceship was
        trying to come down in the direction of a
        predetermined base in Russia.

        8.55 a.m. The Spaceman landed "somewhere
        in Russia" and, soon
        after he landed, he sent this message to
        Moscow:

        "Please report to the Party and Government
        and personally to Nikita Sergeyevitch
        Krushchev that the landing was
        normal. I feel well, have
        no injuries or bruises."

        # NEXT TIME?

        "We will not carry out
        a second experiment until
        we have learned all the
        lessons of the first one."

        Scientists at the conference,
        however, expect another
        Russian to go into
        Space within three months.
        They think he may make
        THREE TRIPS round the
        world.

        # MOSCOW REJOICES

        Moscow went wild with delight . . . and
        from Mr. Krushchev, holidaymaking on the
        Black Sea, came this message to Gagarin:

        "The entire Soviet people acclaims your
        valiant feat, which will be remembered
        down the centuries as an example of courage,
        gallantry and heroism in the name of service
        to mankind. . . .

        With my whole heart I congratulate you
        on your happy return to the homeland from
        your Space journey. I embrace you. Until
        our meeting in
        Moscow soon. . . ."

        Later, Mr. Krushchev
        telephoned the Wild Duck
        and asked how he felt.

        "I feel well," the Spaceman
        replied. "All the
        apparatus the Spaceship
        worked accurately. I saw
        the Earth from a great
        height. Seas, mountains,
        large towns, rivers and
        forests were visible."

        A reporter of the Russian
        newspaper "Izvestia"
        told of seeing Gagarin
        after he landed.

        "He was smiling as only
        a thoroughly happy man
        can do. He was getting
        out of the aircraft. He
        wore a light, sky-blue
        flight suit and a Space-helmet.

        # HAPPY

        "Gagarin embraced one
        of his old friends who met
        him here at the airfield---so
        firmly that it looked as
        though he was wrestling.
        The mood was happy
        and gay one."

        In Florence, Italy,
        where he is attending
        an international Space
        conference. Russia's No. 1
        Space scientist, Professor
        Anatoli Blagonravov, 67,
        heard that his dream of
        putting a man into Space
        had been realised.

        Professor Blagonravov
        was asked: "Was Gagarin
        able to do anything to help
        himself return to earth, or
        was the whole process
        directed and controlled
        from the ground?"

        He replied: "To a certain
        degree the man
        brought himself down, but
        the bulk of the procedure
        was controlled from the
        ground."

        Professor Blagonravov
        added that Gagarin was
        completely Instructed on
        the use of equipment in
        his Spaceship, "even how
        to make small repairs if
        necessary during the
        flight."

        The professor was also
        asked: "When will the next
        Russian go into Space?"

        He said: "That depends
        on the information we get
        from the thorough medical
        overhaul of Major
        Gagarin.

        The earth, he said, had a very
        vivid and beautiful blue halo.

        As he whirled on his 108-minute
        orbit, colours changed
        from ultra marine blue and
        violet to pitch black.

        He flashed from night into
        day in minutes. "Entry into
        the earth's shadow was very
        quick. Darkness seemed to
        descend at once."

        Emergence from the earth's
        shadow also was very quick.
        "Suddenly there was a very
        bright blinding light."

        Gagarin, smiling and laughing,
        was electrifying his
        audience and charming them
        with his frank boyish attitude.

        His space flight, he said, was
        similar to flying at high speed
        in a jet plane.

        He observed the world below
        through a porthole.

        "The Vostok did not carry a
        single camera---therefore there
        are no pictures," he said.

        Asked If the space ship could
        be used again, he laughed:
        "That is, of course, a question
        for scientists but I think the
        entire ship and its parts can
        be used again."

        Gagarin added that he was dedicating his

        Union, to the Soviet Government, to the
        22nd Party Congress and to the whole people

        # HE LANDED ON BOTH FEET

        SPACEMAN Gagarin
        completed the last part
        of his journey back to
        Earth by PARACHUTE,
        Soviet newspapers reported
        yesterday.

        After baling out from
        his Spaceship, Gagarin
        came down in a ploughed
        field "on feet and
        without even tumbling."

        The location of the field
        was not revealed, but the
        first person to greet Gagarin
        was a farm worker
        called Anna.

        She shook his hand when
        he told her who he was.

        THE first greeting for the man back from
        the world's most thrilling adventure 125
        miles above the earth.

        Space conqueror Yuri Gagarin, 27, smiling
        with joy, is seen being congratulated by a
        Soviet Air Force friend soon after he returned
        from his five miles a second trip.

        The first handshake. . . . It was followed
        by world acclaim.

        A few minutes before the picture was
        taken, Gagarin --- whose name means
        Wild Duck---had landed "somewhere in
        Russia."

        Behind him were 108 minutes of drama
        such as the world had not known before.

        TODAY Gagarin returns to Moscow . . .
        to face a hero's welcome. He will be
        greeted in the name of the Russian people
        by Mr. Krushchev . . . and there will be a
        great parade through the streets.

        RUSSIA'S Spaceman,
        Yuri Gagarin, is
        to be presented with a
        gold medal by a
        British trade union.

        The medal will be struck
        by the Amalgamated
        Union of Foundry
        Workers.

        Gagarin, once a moulder
        himself, has accepted
        honorary membership.

        In a letter to the foundry
        workers Gagarin says:

        "Soviet people think of
        their victories In outer
        Space as not their own
        achievement only, but
        as that of working people
        throughout the world."

        A certificate of congratulation
        will be given to
        Gagarin, as well as the
        medal.

        # The way to the stars

        SPACEMAN Yuri Gagarin
        landed near here today fit
        and smiling and told Mr.
        Kruschev on the telephone: "I
        felt fine---just like at home."

        Yuri's first task was to call the
        Soviet Premier at his Black Sea holiday
        headquarters at Sochu. Mr. Kruschev
        asked him how he fared during his 108-minute
        trip round the earth.

        Said 27-year-old Yuri : "It felt good. The
        flight was very successful. All the apparatus
        of the cosmic ship functioned properly. I could
        see the seas, the mountains, big cities, rivers,
        and forests.

        "The sky is very, very dark and the earth is a light
        blue. Everything can be seen very clearly. The shores
        of America were crystal clear."

        ## My wife knew

        MR. KRUSCHEV: "So it can be said that you felt all
        right?---YURI: "You are quite right, Nikita Sergeyovich,
        I felt good on the flight---just like at home. I thank you
        for your heartfelt congratulations and your greetings
        on the successful completion of the flight."

        MR. KRUSCHEV: "Tell me, Yuri Alexeivich, have you
        a wife and children?"---YURI: "Yes, I have a wife,
        Valentina, and two daughters---Yelena and Galina."

        MR. KRUSCHEV: "And your wife, did she know you
        were going to fly in the cosmos?"---YURI: "Yes, she
        knew, Nikita Sergeyovich."

        Then Mr. Kruschev did the talking. He said:
        "Please give my sincere greetings to your wife and
        children. Let your daughters grow up to be proud of
        their father, who performed such a great exploit in the
        name of our Soviet homeland.

        ## We'll celebrate

        "I am happy to hear your voice and to greet you.
        I will be happy to meet you in Moscow. You and I
        together---and all our people---will festively celebrate
        your great feat in mastering the cosmos."

        Yuri said: "Let all countries now catch up with us,"
        and Mr. Kruschev replied: 'You are right. Let the
        capitalist countries catch up with our country, which
        has paved the way to the cosmos, which has sent the
        first astronaut into space round the world.

        "Please convey to your father and mother my
        heartfelt congratulations. They have a right to be
        proud of their son."

        Said Yuri: "Many thanks. I shall convey your
        words to my father and mother. They will be happy
        and deeply thankful to you, the party, and the Soviet
        Government."

        Mr. Kruschev replied: "Not only your parents but
        our whole country is proud
        of you. You have carried out
        a task which will live
        through the centuries.

        "I greet you once more from
        my heart for the successful
        completion of the first cosmic
        flight and I look forward to our
        meeting soon in Moscow. I
        wish you the best of everything."

        But already Moscow and all
        Russia are mad with excitement.
        Exultant crowds seethe
        in the streets, radio and TV
        report the space news non-stop,
        the vodka flows, and everyone
        is celebrating.

        ## THE TWELFTH

        It has been
        like that
        all this incredible April the
        Twelfth, from the moment the
        first confident news flash was
        released this morning---before
        the Russians could know that
        Yuri would come back alive.

        This was Yuri's day of history,
        3½ years after the first Russian
        sputnik had startled the world
        on October 4, 1957:

        6.30 a.m. (8.30 a.m. Moscow
        time): Yuri was winched into
        his cabin in the nose of the
        giant rocket Vostok (it means
        East) somewhere in Russia.

        As the hands of the clock in
        the control building crept towards
        seven he was strapped
        into his bed, specially moulded
        to fit every contour of his body.

        In the control room the
        boffins gathered by two large
        maps. One was divided by a
        thin red line showing the
        course to be followed by the
        spaceship. Then they took their
        places by tables packed with
        loudspeakers and telephones.

        They checked everything.
        The weather was Good---sunny
        and with little wind. That
        made for a good landing. Equipment
        was fully tested. A report
        from the airfield said: "Spaceship
        ready, taxi-ing."

        7.5 a.m. The hatch of spaceship
        Vostok was bolted shut
        and Yuri was on his own. As
        he lay on his back, facing the
        heavens, scientists and fellow-cosmonauts
        chatted to him over
        the radio.

        Then came the count --- the
        Russians count UP to the blastoff.

        7.7 a.m. The giant rocket's
        motors opened up and the
        spaceship was on its way.

        7.22 a.m. First messages from
        Yuri announced: "Over South
        America. The flight is continuing
        O.K. I feel well."

        8.15 a.m. "I am now over South
        Africa. Flight normal. I am
        withstanding well the state of
        weightlessness."

        So the messages crackled
        back to earth. Yuri spoke
        strongly and clearly. He reported:

        "I am carrying out observations
        of the earth. Visibility
        good. Reception excellent . . .

        "The flight continues well.
        Carrying out observations of
        the earth. Visibility good.
        Can see everything. Certain
        spaces are covered with cumulus
        cloud formations . . .

        "The flight continues,
        everything is normal. Everything
        functioning well.
        Everything working well. We
        go farther . . ."

        "I am feeling well and
        cheerful. Continuing the
        flight. Everything is going
        well. The machine is functioning
        normally."

        Meanwhile, in the headquarters
        room, the experts had
        one concern: the health of Yuri
        and how he is feeling.

        The ardio answered from over
        South America. All was well.
        Speed now 18,000 m.p.h., altitude
        up to 187 miles, almost airless
        space, cold that is difficult
        to measure.

        8.25 a.m.: A braking device
        was brought into action and the
        spaceship began to come down
        towards a predetermined area
        in Western Russia.

        8.55 a.m.: Yuri landed. The
        phone rang in the control room.
        A voice full of emotion said:
        "Yuri Gagarin is with us."

        # TUBBY YURI NEEDS MORE SPACE NOW

        IF you want to put on weight, get into orbit. Just ask the world's
        first Spaceman, Major Yuri Gagarin. Since he came back from
        Space, Gagarin has developed a double chin and put on more than
        a stone in weight,
        said Moscow newspapers
        yesterday.

        Tubby Yuri is pictured
        above amid a
        bevy of buxom, pretty
        Russian girls at the
        Communist party
        Congress In Moscow.

        Other pictures
        showing his newly-acquired
        double chin
        were splashed in
        Soviet newspapers.

        Yuri had been out of
        circulation for the past
        two weeks. It was reported
        that he had a
        bad attack of flu.

        But he turned up at
        the Congress yesterday---he
        is a delegate---and
        showed no ill effects.

        A new mineral discovered
        in Eastern
        Kazakhstan has been
        named "gagurinite" in
        his honour said Tass,
        the Soviet news agency.

        # 'WE'RE GOING TO TRY THIS YEAR, BUT...'

        From
        BRUCE ROTHWELL
        Washington, Wednesday

        PRESIDENT
        Kennedy told
        Americans tonight
        that Russia is going
        to lead in space for
        some time to come.

        "As I said in my 'State
        of the Union' message it
        will be worse before it is
        better," he warned.

        "It will be some time
        before we can catch up. We
        are, I hope, going to move
        ahead in other fields."

        When a questioner at his Press
        conference told Mr. Kennedy:
        "Americans are tired of being
        second to Russia in space," the
        President shot back: "The
        Soviet Union has an important
        advantage by having secured
        large booster rockets. That
        advantage is going to be with
        them for some time.

        "However tired anyone may
        be---and no one is more tired
        than I am---it is going to take
        some time for us to catch up and
        I think we have to recognise it.

        "We are going to try this year---but
        we are behind."

        The first reaction here to
        Russia's space feat was to turn
        for solace to the American
        Astronauts. But they were . . .
        ASLEEP.

        "It's 3 a.m. in the morning,
        you jerks," their Press officer,
        Lieut.-Colonel John Powers told
        inquiring newspapermen.

        "If you're wanting something
        from us, we were all asleep."

        In the mass of blame-seeking
        and self-criticism now unleashed
        this statement, above all others,
        will endure.

        The morning radio bulletins
        gave it top place under the
        announcement, in Russian with
        translation, that one Yuri
        Gargarin had gone into the wild
        blue yonder to circle the earth
        and was now back home safe
        and sound.

        By then the Astronauts had
        woken and their spokesman
        offered a more considered
        opinion: "We'd be dishonest if
        we said we weren't disappointed,"
        he said. "We have
        expected the Soviets to do this
        for some time. We all expected
        to wake up some morning and
        find out they had."

        ## Perfect

        Conditions at the Space
        headquarters here in
        Florida tonight were practically
        perfect.

        An Englishman who
        was "just an average
        pupil" at a tiny village
        school Is the man who will
        be responsible for rescuing
        Shepard from the Atlantic
        after his fifteen-minute
        Space trip.

        He is Peter Armitage, 32,

        Americans' chief expert on
        "Spaceman recovery."

        # WHOSE FACE IN SPACE?

        IT WILL BE ONE OF THESE MEN . .

        _3_ John Glenn

        _2_ Virgil Grissom

        _1_ Alan Shepard

        ONLY two names
        are left on the
        list from which
        America's first
        Spaceman will be
        picked.

        If all goes well the
        chosen man will be shot
        into the sky early on
        ~~Tuesday~~ *POSTPONED TILL FRIDAY 3:34PM GMT*

        The third name on the
        list was crossed off today,
        I understand.

        It may have been that of
        the "baby" of the team,
        Captain Virgil Grissom, 35.

        I saw Grissom today visiting
        his wife, Betty, at a
        motel outside the Space
        base.

        "Are you out?" I asked
        him.

        Grissom replied: "Well,
        I'm not at the Cape, am
        I?"

        The other two men on
        the list are Col. John
        Glenn, 39, of the Marines,
        and Commander Alan
        Shepard, 37, of the Navy.

        Even the chosen astronaut
        will not know until
        five hours before the blastoff
        that he is the one to
        be strapped into a Space
        capsule little bigger than
        a telephone booth.

        As he soars into Space,
        his two astronaut colleagues
        will work as part
        of the ground team for
        Project Mercury---as the
        Space flight is named.

        One of them will speak
        with him by radio during
        his trip. Throughout the
        week-end the three Astronauts
        have been rehearsing
        their Space drill inside
        the Space cabin itself---fixed
        on top of a 30-ton
        Redstone rocket on a
        launch pad.

        But though there are
        still forty-eight hours to go
        to the blast-off---if all goes
        without a hitch---the ballyhoo
        button has already
        been pressed.

        America is in for a severe
        bout of Space fever.

        About 90,000,000 Americans
        are expected to be
        glued to their television sets
        to watch the 83ft. rocket
        zoom off into Space.

        Cape Canaveral has been
        turned into Cape Carnival
        as thousands of families
        from up to 100 miles
        around poured in to Cocoa
        Beach---the nearest public
        point to the blast-off pad.

        Out in the Atlantic the
        US Navy ships are already
        waiting to move into the
        Spaceman's landing area.

        All America is hoping his
        capsule plop safely into
        the ocean and that he is
        picked up.

        Getting their Astronaut
        aloft for his brief fifteen-minute
        trip that will take
        him 115 miles up and 290
        miles out from the Cape
        is going to cost the
        United States taxpayer
        £150,000,000.

        Almost everybody will regard
        it as a good bargain
        if the attempt succeeds.

        If Project Mercury is a
        success, then before the
        end of the year America
        will send a man into orbit
        around the Earth---just as
        Russian Yuri Gagarin
        went around the Earth
        eighteen days ago.

        Russian test pilot Vladimir
        Ilyushin, now in
        Peking, China, has denied
        a report that he made a
        trip into Space before
        Gagarin, says Tass, the
        Russian news agency.

        IT was a great day for
        "steam" radio.

        British audiences had no direct
        TV link in Cape Canaveral. But
        the BBC's on-the-spot sound
        broadcast brought listeners all
        the drama and thrills of Alan
        Shepard's epoch-making venture
        into Space.

        Just three minutes after take-off
        the American commentator
        announced excitedly:
        "Alan Shepard is now America's
        first man in Space. He's made
        it."

        "This is it," said the commentator.
        "Nine eight, seven, six, five,
        four, three, two, one . . . ZERO."

        A voice in the background said:
        "Ignition on." Then there came
        the roar of the rocket's mighty
        engines.

        "It's leaving the launching pad
        slowly, very slowly. It is mounting
        skywards. Everything seems
        to be okay. . . . Now it's going
        higher and faster," shouted the
        commentator.

        Fifteen minutes later we heard a
        burst of wild cheering from the
        crew of the United States carrier
        Lake Champlain, 297 miles out
        in the Atlantic.

        The Space capsule, supported by
        a huge parachute, had smacked
        down right in the target area.
        Shepard HAD made it.

        MOSCOW --- Tass the
        official Russian news
        agency, said last night that
        Shepard's flight "cannot
        be compared" with the
        flight of Yuri Gagarin,
        Russia's first man in
        Space.

        Tass pointed out that
        Gagarin's trip lasted 108
        minutes, Shepard's only
        fifteen.

        LONDON.---Mr. Harold
        Macmillan, the Prime
        Minister, has sent a personal
        message to President
        Kennedy congratulating
        him on America's success

        ## The View

        Then, in the background, a Space
        capsule radio monitor reported
        the Astronaut's first reaction:

        "What a beautiful view."
        It was almost as though one was
        up there with him. . . .

        Earlier, the tension was terrific
        as take-off time finally approached
        after six agonising
        delays, and the count-down
        began.

        The President said he
        was looking forward to seeing
        Shepard in Washington
        on Monday.

        The fifteen-minute fight
        cost each one of the
        180,000,000 American citizens
        about 17s. That was
        the cost of financing the
        flight programme

        PRACTICALLY the last
        words Shepard spoke
        before he stepped into his
        Spaceship were: "Here I
        go, Dee"---to his personal
        nurse, pretty brunette
        Lieutenant Dolores O'Hara.

        A few minutes later---just
        before the blast-off---America's
        90,000,000 television
        viewers showed
        Dolores almost in tears, and
        praying near the launching
        pad.

        Ninety million Americans watched on television
        the 5,100 m.p.h. rocket-shot that has given
        a
        tremendous boost to the nation's spirits.

        One of them was President Kennedy---who
        telephoned a "Well done" message to Spaceman
        Shepard from the White House.

        In Britain, too, millions followed
        the thrilling count-down and the
        progress of the Spaceship on the
        radio. A reporter who heard it all
        in the Mirror office in London
        said: "The tension was terrific.
        It was like being there."

        ## MORE FLIGHTS

        After this great day for America,
        what now? Mirror Space Reporter
        Ronald Bedford cabled from the U.S.
        Space HQ in Florida last night: "There
        will be more Man in Space flights in the
        next few weeks.

        "Just before Christmas it is planned
        to send a Spaceman---probably Shepard
        again---to orbit the earth three times
        and land him in the sea at about the
        same spot as today."

        AT exactly thirteen
        seconds after
        3.34 p.m. (British
        time) here today,
        there was a shattering
        roar.

        Flames spurted from
        the base of a giant,
        66ft.-long rocket topped
        by a tiny, bell-shaped
        cabin, and . .

        W-H-O-O-S-H!---Commander
        Alan Shepard,
        37, was tearing
        through Space on the
        flight that thrilled
        the whole free world.

        Up, up into a clear
        blue sky, then 115 miles
        into the nothingness of
        Space flew the gleaming
        silver cabin carrying
        America's first astronaut---and
        the nation's hopes.

        Fifteen minutes later
        exactly according to plan
        and after touching a top
        speed of 5,100 m.p.h.
        Shepard's Spaceship gently
        parachuted down into the
        Atlantic.

        It landed smack in the
        target area, 297 miles from
        the launching pad here in
        Florida.

        This wonderful, exciting
        day in the life of Spaceman
        Shepard began at
        2 a.m. (American time)
        when his personal doctor
        woke him up with a tap
        on the shoulder.

        After a shower and a
        shave, Shepard breakfasted
        on a steak rolled in
        bacon, two poached eggs
        and orange juice.

        At 2.45 he went for a
        thorough, last-minute
        medical check-up.

        He was wearing Space
        underwear---specially-padded
        long underpants.

        Just after 3 a.m. he put
        on his silver 30lb. Spacesuit

        There was a series of
        small delays---passing
        clouds, slight "technical
        hitches," last-minute
        adjustments.

        There was a flurry of excitement
        as an "emergency"
        siren wailed. Ambulances
        rushed to the firing
        pad---but it was only a
        technician who had fainted
        with excitement.

        And no wonder. The tension
        was almost unbearable.
        "If they paid this guy
        1,000,000 dollars to sit up
        there and face this sort of
        thing it would not be
        enough," said an admiring
        scientist.

        Shepard had been in
        his Spaceship three-and-a-half
        hours when the final
        count-down came: THREE
        . . . TWO . . . ONE . . .
        ZERO---and he was off in
        a roar of flame and followed
        by a mighty cheer.

        Within a minute of the
        blast-off, as the rocket
        streaked up leaving a
        white smoke trail, Shepard's
        voice came loud and
        cleared into the control
        centre.

        His first words were:
        "WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
        VIEW!"

        Then he began reporting
        technical information
        about the flight, all the
        time calmly and skilfully
        guiding and manoeuvring
        his fantastic ship.

        ## PERFECT

        Finally, Shepard began to
        talk to the fleet of waiting
        ships, telling them his
        parachute was opening . . .
        and he was drifting seawards
        for his 20 m.p.h.
        landing.

        It was a perfect "pick
        up."

        Before being whisked to
        the Bahamas for a medical
        examination Shepard had
        a "snack" --- a shrimp
        cocktail, a roast beef sandwich
        and iced tea.

        He washed the "snack"
        down with champagne.

        In the Bahamas he was
        ordered to bed---for a rest.

        After all, he had been on
        a long journey. . . .

        # 'U.S. COULD HAVE BEEN IN SPACE FIRST'

        From RONALD BEDFORD
        Washington, Monday

        ## But it wasn't the plan, says Shepard

        ALAN SHEPARD, America's first
        Spaceman---who was given a
        hero's welcome here today---could
        have been the WORLD'S No. 1
        Man in Space.

        He was asked tonight if the rocket
        shot which fired him 115 miles up into
        Space last Friday could have been made
        before Russia's Major Yuri Gagarin
        orbited the earth a few weeks earlier.

        Shepard replied: "The answer is Yes. We could
        have gone a lot earlier." But it had been decided,
        he added, that America's Space programme
        should "proceed on an
        orderly basis."

        Shepard, 37, was answering
        questions fired at him
        at a Press conference here
        attended by 400 reporters
        from all over America and
        the world.

        ## STRAIN

        During this ordeal he
        showed more sign of strain
        than at any time during
        his earlier welcome from
        President Kennedy and
        cheering hundreds of thousands
        who jammed the
        streets of the American
        capital.

        But each time any sign
        of nervousness appeared,
        his pretty wife, Louise,
        sitting in the front row,
        flashed him a dazzling
        smile that restored his
        confidence.

        Shepard was asked why
        he spent some moments
        looking up and down the
        big Redstone rocket before
        he climbed aboard his
        Space-ship.

        He joked: "I realised I
        might never see the outside
        of that missile again, so I
        thought it appropriate to
        look it over."

        He proved his complete
        candour when he was asked
        whether he felt nervous at
        any time about Friday's
        mission.

        He replied: "We went
        into this thing with our
        eyes open. We realised the
        possibilities of partial success
        or of failure. There
        was apprehension."

        And he showed generosity
        when, time and again, he
        pointed out that the six
        other astronauts were as
        well trained as he was for
        the trip.

        Would he want to be the
        first man shot into orbit?
        "All seven of us would," he
        replied.

        ## TRIBUTE

        At the end of the hour-long
        conference there was
        a tremendous burst of
        applause, and every reporter
        stood up in tribute
        as Shepard, with his wife,
        walked from the platform.

        Earlier today, after flying
        with his family in a
        helicopter which landed
        them on the lawns of the
        White House, Shepard was
        presented by the President
        with the Distinguished
        Service Medal of the
        National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration.

        Said Mr. Kennedy: "This
        flight was made out in the
        open, with all the possibilities
        of failure, which would
        have been damaging to our
        country's prestige.

        "Because a great risk
        was taken in this regard,
        we think we have some
        right to claim that this
        open society of ours, which
        risked much, gained much."

        AMERICA fired her first man into
        Space yesterday. And the flight
        was a brilliant success.

        The first astronaut of the Western world,
        37-year-old Alan Shepard, soared 115 miles
        up into Space.

        He parachuted into the Atlantic at 20 mph,
        according to plan, exactly fifteen minutes
        later.

        AMERICA has put HER
        man triumphantly into
        Space and brought him
        back alive.

        Not secretly, like the
        Russians, but in the full
        glare of publicity for the
        whole world to see and
        cheer---or to know if the
        bid failed.

        That took courage. The

        . . . and the new Spaceman
        who has found fame.

        # U.S. JUMPING WITH JOY
        From JOHN EDWARDS, New York, Friday

        THE whole of America is hopping
        with happiness over Commander
        Shepard's Space flight. There is singing
        in the streets. There is joy and jubilation
        in millions of homes.

        Hero Shepard has set the country glowing
        with his ride in a Redstone rocket.

        When he was blasted off from the pad at Cape
        Canaveral the hearts of all Americans beat faster.

        In New York taxis pulled into the
        kerbs to listen to radio commentaries.

        Television sets were switched on in
        showroom windows. Pedestrians jammed
        the pavements to get a view.

        Business in the skyscraper office blocks
        slowed to nothing. Everybody jostled for
        position at radio or television.

        It was the same in Washington. President
        Jack Kennedy and his family and
        top advisers watched, too.

        Behind the drawn curtains in a little
        house in Virginia Beach---500 miles from
        the launching site---the Spaceman's wife,
        Mrs. Louise Shepard, watched the event
        anxiously

        When Commander Shepard was recovered
        safely she flung her arms into
        the air and said: "It was just wonderful,
        wonderful. I knew, I knew from the
        minute the rocket went up he was going
        to be all right. I just wiped away the
        tears."

        When the rescue helicopter
        planted hero
        Shepard on the deck of the
        carrier there was a phone
        call waiting for him.

        It was the President.

        Mr. Kennedy congratulated
        Commander Shepard
        and asked him how he felt.
        Shepard replied: "Everything
        worked just about
        perfectly."

        # Wonderful!

        Mrs. Louise Shepard, wife of America's
        Spaceman, laughs with joy and relief
        yesterday.

        "It's just wonderful, wonderful, wonderful,"
        she said at her home at Virginia
        Beach, Virginia.

        In Moscow last night,
        Tass, the official Russian
        news agency, said that
        Shepard's flight "cannot
        be compared" with the
        flight of Yuri Gagarin,
        Russia's first man in Space.

        Shepard travelled only
        302 miles in fifteen minutes,
        said Tass, while Gagarin
        went right around the
        earth, and his flight took
        108 minutes.

        Tass said "Yuri Gagarin
        was in a state of weightlessness
        during the entire time
        his spaceship was in orbit
        but the American astronaut
        was in this state for
        only several minutes."

        Moscow Radio gave only
        the bare facts of Shepard's
        flight in a news broadcast.

        IT was a great day for
        "steam" radio. . . .
        British audiences had no
        direct TV link in Cape
        Canaveral. But the BBC's
        on-the-spot sound broadcast
        brought listeners all the
        drama and thrills of Alan
        Shepard's epoch-making
        venture into Space.

        The tension was terrific
        as take-off time approached.
        Then just three
        minutes after take-off an
        American commentator announced
        excitedly:

        "Alan Shepard is now
        America's first man in
        Space. He's made it."

        In the background, a
        Space capsule radio monitor
        reported the Astronaut's
        first reaction:
        "What a beautiful view."

        FULLY fit---that was the doctors' verdict
        last night on American Space
        hero, Commander Alan Shepard, after
        they had examined him at a base in the
        Bahamas.

        One of the doctors, Colonel William
        Douglas, said he did not think further
        tests would show the astronaut had suffered
        any ill effects.

        A psychiatrist, Dr. George Ruff, who also
        examined Shepard, said he was "pleased and
        somewhat amazed"
        that the Space man was
        in "such good shape."

        Before he took off on his
        triumphant journey into
        Space, Shepard told scientists
        at the launching pad:

        "Heck, I want to be the
        first just because I want
        to be first.

        "I guess it's American to
        want to be first in things.

        "That just about sums it
        up for me."

        AMERICA'S first man in Space and hero No. 1,
        Naval Commander Alan Shepard, 37, thought
        at one time that he would not be given the chance
        to make history for his country.

        For when invitations were sent out by the Government
        asking for Space volunteers, Commander Shepard did not
        get a letter.

        He was on the
        original list of 110
        Servicemen who
        were to be asked to
        volunteer.

        But his invitation was
        MISLAID.

        Shepard was crestfallen.
        He believed his
        name had been taken
        off the list.

        ## FOUND

        Then the letter was
        found---and sent off.
        Shepard's reply: "Yes,
        I'll volunteer."

        After the code name
        "Project Mercury" had
        been given to America's
        plans for manned Space
        flight, the serious business
        of selecting a small seven-man
        Space team began.

        Gradually the list was
        whittled down to the seven
        men---among them Commander
        Shepard.

        Their astronaut training
        involved as much brain
        work as physical preparation.

        In addition to being
        whirled, swung and jerked
        under conditions likely to
        be encountered in Spaceflight,
        they had to go to
        "school" again.

        In February this year,
        the three "most suitable"
        members of the seven-man
        team were told that
        America's first astronaut
        would be one of them.

        Again Shepard won his
        way to the VIP list.

        Finally, as the world
        knows, non-smoking, family
        man Shepard was told:
        "You will be America's
        first Spaceman."

        During his training
        Shepard, son of a retired
        Army colonel, was paid
        about £80 a week.

        For his fifteen-minute
        flight into Space he was
        paid nothing extra.

        But the U.S. Government
        took out a £5,500 insurance
        policy on him for the
        flight and a magazine has
        bought Shepard's story. He
        will receive £25,000.

        Muscular, blue-eyed
        Shepard was born in East
        Derry, New Hampshire,
        and began his service
        career at Annapolis Naval
        Academy.

        In World War II he
        served aboard a destroyer
        in the Pacific and later
        became a Navy test pilot.

        All his life he has loved
        speed and thrills.

        Most of his spare time
        he spends driving fast
        sports cars or swishing
        over the surf in water
        skis.

        When he first began
        water ski-ing Shepard used
        two skis, then only one.
        Finally, he dispensed with
        skis altogether, and hunted
        around for a boat fast
        enough to pull him across
        the water on his BARE
        FEET.

        A "cool, calm guy" and
        "very bright" is how
        Shepard's colleagues describe
        him.

        Commander Shepard's
        triumph yesterday has been
        the "shot in the arm" that
        America's Space programme
        badly needed.

        While the Russians were
        making steady progress
        with their manned Space
        plans, the Americans were
        having frequent failures.

        AMERICA has put HER man
        triumphantly into Space
        and brought him back alive.

        Not secretly, like the Russians,
        but in the full glare of publicity
        for the whole world to see and
        cheer---or to
        know if the bid
        failed.

        That took
        courage. The
        Mirror salutes this great American
        achievement . . . and the
        new Spaceman who has found
        fame. Here's to a brave man---American
        astronaut Alan
        Shepard!

        From JOHN EDWARDS, New York, Friday

        AFTER her long, lonely
        wait for blast-off time,
        Louise Shepard, wife of Commander
        Alan Shepard, the
        West's first Spaceman, settled
        down tonight to another wait.

        For officials of Project Mercury---the
        Space flight code name---told
        her: "It may be two days before
        you can speak to Alan.

        "He must complete his medical
        check first."

        ## ISOLATED

        Spaceman Shepard is on Grand
        Bahama Island. Wife Louise, 34, waits in
        their trim little home at Virginia Beach,
        1,000 miles away.

        Tonight she said: "I thought I would
        have been able to call Alan right away.

        "But he is still isolated with the
        medics."

        Mrs. Shepard watched her husband's
        epic flight on television.

        When he had been safely landed on
        the pick-up aircraft carrier, she said: "It
        was just wonderful! Wonderful!

        "I knew from the minute
        the rocket went up he was
        going to be all right."

        Asked if she would like
        to see her hero husband
        orbit the Earth like Russia's
        Yuri Gagarin, she
        said: "Yes, I would since
        he wants it so badly. This
        is just a baby step."

        TONIGHT all America is
        hopping with happiness
        over the flight. There's
        joy in the homes; singing
        in the streets.

        At Derry, New Hampshire,
        crowds cheered the
        Spaceman's parents as they
        drove in procession
        through their home town.

        At blast-off time this
        morning millions were
        glued to television screens
        and radios.

        Taxi drivers pulled in to
        the kerbside to hear the
        live broadcast. Business
        stopped in skyscraper office
        blocks while workers clustered
        around TV sets.

        ALAN SHEPARD, America's
        conquering hero of Space, is
        hauled up from the Atlantic after
        making HISTORY.

        This dramatic picture was taken
        from the helicopter that picked up
        thirty-seven-year-old Commander
        Shepard when he came down in his
        Space capsule after soaring 115
        miles into the sky yesterday.

        And, as he stepped aboard the
        helicopter, his first words were:
        "BOY! WHAT A RIDE!"

        Ninety million Americans watched
        on television the
        5,100 m.p.h.
        rocket-shot that
        has given a tremendous
        boost to
        the nation's spirits.

        One of them was
        President Kennedy---who
        telephoned
        a "Well done"
        message to Spaceman
        Shepard from
        the White House.

        ## THRILL

        In Britain, and
        all over the rest of
        the free world, millions
        more followed
        the thrilling flight.

        NEW YORK, Monday.

        YES - it IS Virgil
        Grissom for
        America's next Space
        flight.

        Space research chiefs
        today confirmed that Air
        Force Captain Grissom,
        35, will be aboard America's
        second manned Space
        capsule when it is
        launched tomorrow---around
        midday, British
        time---at Cape Canaveral,
        Florida.

        Grissom, who is expected
        to repeat the 115-mile,
        straight-up-and-down trip
        made last May by Navy
        Commander Alan Shepard,
        said today:

        "I'm not the hero type. I
        know I'm going to be scared
        when I get in that capsule."

        But Grissom---married
        with two schoolboy sons---added:
        "I can also remember
        worrying a bit, as a boy,
        before I took my first swim
        in a stone quarry . . ."

        # A hero's welcome

        THE tension of
        the count-down
        is over. Now comes
        the touch-down . . .

        Crewmen of the aircraft
        carrier Lake
        Champlain gather,
        above, to cheer SpacemanAlan Shepard as
        the helicopter that
        scooped him from the
        Atlantic comes in to
        land. Swinging under
        the helicopter is the
        capsule in which
        Shepard made his historic
        flight.

        Shepard was hoisted
        aboard the 'copter
        after climbing out of
        the capsule as it
        floated in the sea.

        MESSAGES from
        all over the
        world praising
        Russia's new
        Space triumph began
        to pour into
        Moscow soon after
        the news of the
        blast-off.

        The first Soviet Spaceman,
        Major Yuri
        Gagarin, who is in
        Canada, sent a
        special radio message
        to Titov.

        ## Excited

        It was relayed to the
        Spaceship from Moscow
        and said:

        "Dear Gherman, from
        my heart I am with
        you. I embrace you,
        my friend, and kiss
        you hard.

        "I am excitedly following
        your flight. I am
        sure your flight will
        be successfully completed
        and will once
        again bring glory to
        our great homeland."

        As soon as he heard of
        his country's new
        Space achievement,
        Major Gagarin decided
        to fly back to
        Russia so that he
        could greet Titov
        when he landed.

        ## Brave

        IN AMERICA, Mr.
        Adlai Stevenson, US
        Ambassador to the
        United Nations, said:

        Russia's scientific contribution
        to the conquest
        of outer Space
        commands our admiration.
        Let us
        hope the capsule is
        recovered and the
        life of this brave
        man saved.

        I am sure those are
        the views of President
        Kennedy and I
        am sure also this
        event sharpens the
        need for some action
        to regulate the use of
        outer Space and to
        keep the arms race
        from spreading to
        that field.

        THE most amazing journey in history ended
        triumphantly yesterday when Gherman Titov,
        26, code-named "Eagle," dipped down in his Spaceship,
        Vostok II, and landed in a Russian field.

        Farm workers, who had been harvesting grain, ran to meet
        him. They embraced Titov, said a Moscow report last night.
        And a tractor driver said to him: "My dear fellow, I heartily
        congratulate you!"

        CONGRATULATIONS . . . on Space
        flight lasting 25 hours 18 minutes in
        which he made 17 complete circuits of
        the Earth.

        CONGRATULATIONS . . . on an
        18,000-mile-an-hour journey totalling
        435,000 miles---almost the distance from
        the Earth to the Moon and back again.

        Titov landed near Smelovka, about
        400 miles south-east of Moscow.

        In this area special apparatus has been
        set up to guide returning Spacemen---for
        it was here that Spaceman No. 1, Yuri
        Gagarin, landed after his 108-minute
        flight in April.

        ## Parachutes

        It is believed that Titov came down in
        the same way as Gagarin---with Vostok II
        suspended from parachutes which Titov
        released after his Spaceship entered the
        Earth's atmosphere.

        After Titov landed, the farm workers
        helped him out of his Space suit. They
        asked him if he was lonely whirling along
        110 miles out in Space. He replied:

        "I was not lonely . . . I had good link
        with Earth. I heard radio broadcast
        from my native land . . . our Soviet
        music."

        Titov went to a nearby house to phone
        Mr. Krushchev. As he phoned, thousands
        of people swarmed round the house, shouting: "Titov! Titov!"

        ## Gigantic

        That was only a foretaste of the gigantic
        greeting which awaits Titov when he
        reaches Moscow today or tomorrow.

        For Titov there will be an airport
        welcome in Moscow, a Red Square rally
        and a Kremlin reception. And a reunion
        with his wife, twenty-three-year-old
        Tamara. When she was told yesterday
        that her husband had landed safely
        Tamara said:

        "I am very proud of my
        husband. We Soviet women
        are the happiest because
        our husbands and brothers
        are first in everything."

        Tamara spent most of
        yesterday with Yuri
        Gagarin's wife, Valentina
        and two Gagarin children.

        Gherman and Tamara
        had a son who died when
        he was seven months old.

        Britain's Prime Minister
        Harold Macmillan,
        yesterday wired Mr.
        Krushchev: "Please convey
        my congratulations to
        Major Titov and to all concerned
        with this great feat
        of science and technology."

        RUSSIA will send a
        third man into Space
        in the next few months---almost
        certainly before
        Christmas---for a week
        or possibly ten days.

        This new trip could give
        Russian scientists the experience
        necessary to plan a
        return journey to THE
        MOON.

        But a lot depends on radiation
        tests now taking place on
        Spaceman Titov. He will be
        a "prisoner" of doctors for
        the next forty-eight hours
        for an exhaustive medical
        examination.

        An answer on the radiation
        problem will come from
        his Space suit---which had
        special photographic film
        inset over vital areas of his
        body.

        ## Highest

        The Vostok II flew below the
        belt of intense radiation
        which begins 200 miles above
        the Earth. The highest point
        the Space ship reached was
        just under 160 miles.

        But Major Titov must have
        been hit by strong bursts
        of radiation.

        The Major revealed in a
        broadcast that he had
        "living organisms" with
        him on the Space ship.

        They were likely to be mice,
        insects and fruit flies---all
        particularly useful in
        making radiation measurements.

        The doctors will also study in
        detail the record of Major
        Titov's pulse and breathing
        rates and other data tape-recorded
        during his long
        period of weightlessness.

        If all the tests are favourable,
        Cosmonaut No. 3 may be
        sent further out into Space.

        On the Moon flight a Spaceman
        will spend several hours
        of his journey in the area of
        heaviest radiation.

        ## How Long?

        How long will it be before the
        Russians solve all the problems?

        If they continue to increase
        their Space-race lead over
        America at the present rate,
        there could be a Russian on
        the Moon by August Bank
        Holiday, 1965.

        FEELING fine. Again and again
        yesterday the Eagle sent this
        message back from Space . . .

        Eagle is the code name of Major
        Gherman Stepariovich Titov, the fourth
        man in Space and the second man to be
        put into orbit.

        The first man into orbit was Major Yuri
        Gagarin, a Russian
        colleague of Titov. The
        Americans have yet to
        put a man into orbit,
        but two of their astronauts
        have made quick
        up-and-down trips into
        Space.

        Late last night Titov,
        twenty-six-year-old Russian
        Air Force major,
        was still whirling round
        the Earth at 18,000
        m.p.h.

        He paused from his work
        in his craft for a "three
        course lunch" and for
        "dinner"---special food
        preparations squeezed
        from tubes like toothpaste.

        Last night Major Titov
        radioed that he was going
        to have a seven-hour sleep.
        His base cut off all radio
        communication so that he
        should not be disturbed.

        As he settled down he
        sent this message: "Everything
        is going fine. Please
        say goodnight to the dear
        Muscovites. I am now
        going to bed."

        Major Titov was rocketed
        up in the Spaceship Vostok
        II at 6 a.m.

        He was expected down
        this morning---after circling
        the earth 17 times---once
        every 88½ minutes.

        As Vostok II rushed
        round, at a height of between
        110 and 160 miles,
        Titov sent greetings to
        Asia, Africa, Australia,
        South America and Europe.

        ## Jubilant

        Moscow Radio broadcast
        a recording of a conversation
        Titov had with colleagues
        on Earth.

        He was told: The whole
        of Moscow is jubilant.
        Muscovites send their
        ardent greetings and wish
        you to complete your
        flight successfully.

        Titov: Thank you, dear
        Muscovites. Will soon be
        back on Earth. We shall
        meet soon.

        Moscow: During the
        fifth-revolution note the
        time of the entry and exit
        from the Earth's shadow
        and report back during
        your sixth revolution.

        Titov: I understand. I
        shall try to determine the
        time and report back during
        the sixth revolution.

        Moscow: Report
        pressure in cabin.

        Titov: The pressure remains
        at 1.05 atmospheres,
        temperature 20 degrees,
        humidity 75 per cent.

        The Spaceship is thought
        to be almost exactly the
        same as that in which the
        first man in Space, Major
        Gagarin, went up.

        But unlike Gagarin,
        whose flight was controlled
        from Earth, Titov was said
        to be partially piloting the
        craft himself.

        Yesterday's flight almost
        certainly began from Russia's
        "Cape Canaveral" at
        Baikonur, in Kazakh
        republic.

        ## Fine

        On his second orbit,
        Titov, son of a schoolteacher,
        sent Soviet leader
        Mr. Krushchev a message
        over his two-way radio link
        with Earth.

        He said he was feeling
        fine and that all was normal.

        Mr. Krushchev radioed
        back his congratulations
        and added: "We embrace
        you."

        Meanwhile, Titov's reactions
        to the flight were
        televised to Russian scientists.

        They said he was
        smiling. . . .

        In Red Square, Moscow
        a crowd gathered . . . and
        gazed skywards when
        Vostok II was due to pass
        over the city.

        They saw nothing. An
        official explained it would
        be impossible to see the
        Spaceship with the naked
        eye.

        ## Drama

        The BBC's listening
        station at Caversham,
        Berks, picked up fragments
        of the Spaceman's messages.

        They included his call
        sign---"I am Eagle, I am
        Eagle"---and assurances
        that he was "feeling fine
        . . very well."

        Spaceman Titov is married.
        His twenty-four-year-old
        wife is called Tamara.

        Russia's second venture
        into Space sets the stage
        dramatically for Mr.
        Krushchev's speech tonight
        on the Berlin crisis.

        He is known to like a
        major accomplishment to
        precede an important pronouncement,
        and the new
        Space shot has been freely
        predicted by Muscovites.

        # Cosmonaut 'Saw No God or Angels'

        From Press Dispatches

        SEATTLE --- Soviet cosmonaut
        Gherman Titov said he saw "no
        God or angels" during his 17 orbits
        of the earth.

        The question came up at a news
        conference at the Seattle World's
        Fair whether the 25 hours he spent
        in space had changed his philosophy
        or way of thinking.

        "Some people say there is a God
        out there," the 27-year-old Soviet
        major replied. "But in my travels
        around the earth all day long I
        looked around and didn't see him.
        I saw no God or angels.

        "Up to our first orbital flight by
        Yuri Gagarin no God helped build
        our rocket. The rocket was made
        by our people. I don't believe in
        God. I believe in man, his strength,
        his possibilities and his reason."

        Titov expounded on his materialistic
        faith after he and his wife
        had spent nearly two hours touring
        the U.S. science exhibit at the
        fair. They were personally conducted
        by Dr. Athelstan Spilhaus,
        federal commissioner of the exhibit.

        ## Takes U.S. 'Space Ride'

        Titov took a simulated trip a
        billion billion miles into outer space
        in the science pavilion's spacearium,
        but said the moving picture
        did not depict the return to earth
        the way he saw it when he finished
        his space flight.

        "I couldn't see all of the earth
        as you would from outer space,"
        he said. "The height of my capsule
        was lower and the angle of the
        earth's dimension different."

        Titov praised the $6 million U.S.
        science display, saying he "liked it
        very much" and felt it was something
        everyone should see. He was
        particularly interested in a complex
        electronic computer which
        sent an imaginary satellite into
        orbit, and in a tracking station
        for a Transit navigational satellite
        now orbiting the earth.

        Later, in San Francisco, Titov
        smilingly criticized the U.S. space
        program.

        He told a news conference that
        if he were invited to join an American
        in a U.S. spacecraft, "I would
        be a bit afraid because there have
        been quite a lot of failures in
        your program."

        He said he had seen the spacecraft
        in which U.S. astronaut Alan
        B. Shepard made a suborbital space
        flight. Titov remarked: "It's not
        even good enough for flying in
        orbit."

        As for American automobiles, the
        cosmonaut said, "it seems to me
        you have to pay more attention
        to this problem." He said that it's
        just a matter of time before Americans
        will be able to get places
        faster by walking than by driving.

        ## Mum on The Moon

        The handsome Russian major
        parried questions about which
        country would land a man on the
        moon first and about the existence
        of God.

        He said his grandfather believed
        in God, but that his grandmother
        did not, and kept throwing religious
        pictures out the window. The
        grandmother, he said, is still alive,
        and grandfather is not.

        "We have an example here that
        belief in God does not always help.
        I believe in toil and labor and the
        reason of man."

        # TITOV GETS ICE-COLD 'WELCOME'

        From JOHN EDWARDS
        New York, Monday

        RUSSIAN Spaceman
        Gherman Titov
        thrilled the Soviet
        Union with his cry: "I
        am an eagle!" as he
        whirled seventeen
        times around the world.

        But he has not
        thrilled anybody in
        New York, where he is
        staying on the first leg
        of his trip to the
        United States.

        Few people have paid
        the slightest attention to
        him.

        When he arrived in New
        York yesterday he got the
        back door treatment.

        ## Dismal

        His Russian turbo-jet
        was ushered to the dismal
        side of New York's international
        airport, where
        the glamorous, glittering
        terminal building peters
        out into a collection of
        wooden huts and sheds.

        His reception committee,
        entirely Russian,
        stood out in a cold wind.
        Some Russian girls
        shouted and threw flowers.

        But no American Government
        official was there
        to say "Welcome."

        ## Unfriendly

        One man who saw the
        waiting Russians asked
        me "Who's flying [...]
        pop singer or something?"

        Gherman Titov must
        think the Americans are
        an unfriendly lot. Last
        night he went on a few
        orbits around Manhattan.
        He tried to look at home.
        He offered a couple of
        waves out of the window
        of his car. Nobody waved
        back.

        I don't think they knew
        who he was, or what he
        had done.

        He went to the United
        Nations today to have
        lunch with Acting Secretary-General
        U Thant and
        to shake hands with a few
        other top officials

        ## Boos

        Very formal and slightly
        more friendly.

        But there were some
        definitely unfriendly
        people around when Titov
        went to Wall-street.

        As he watched the
        bustling activity of the
        New York Stock Exchange
        most of the stockbrokers
        cheered him.

        But there was scattered
        booing.

        I hope the Russian
        hero gets more than
        the cold shoulder when he
        goes to Washington to
        address a Space conference
        and meet another
        Space hero, John H.
        Glenn.

        After all, he was invited.

        "Goodnight, Moscow,"
        He was blasted off
        in his 4½-ton Spaceship,
        Vostok II, at 6 a.m. yesterday.

        Throughout the day, Titov,
        married and a pilot in the
        Soviet Air Force, reported
        that he was "feeling fine."

        If all goes well he should
        land "somewhere in Russia"
        this morning---after twenty-four
        hours in Space and seventeen
        trips around the Earth.

        ## GREETING

        Major Yuri Gagarin, the
        first Spaceman, who made
        ONE circuit of the Earth lasting
        108 minutes, decided yesterday
        to break off a visit to
        Canada and return to Russia
        to greet Titov.

        His first duty was to phone Mr.
        K. And he confessed that while
        resting during the night, he overslept.
        He woke up half an hour later
        than planned.

        Mr. Krushchev, hugely
        delighted with the
        flight, thought nothing
        of this "lapse."

        Titov, in Space, had
        about eight hours' sleep.
        His wife, Tamara, 23,
        waiting anxiously by the
        radio in Moscow, had no
        sleep at all while he was
        in flight.

        The Spaceman told Mr.
        Kruschev that Tamara, at

        make the flight . . . but
        later she approved.

        RUSSIA'S second Spaceman, handsome
        26-year-old Major Gherman Titov, who
        was blasted off yesterday, was whirling
        triumphantly round the Earth at 18,000
        mph early today.

        He had a "three course lunch" of concentrated
        foods squeezed from tubes. A few hours later he
        had "dinner"---again squeezed from tubes.

        Above is the Spaceship in which

        It is believed that Russia's second
        man in Space, Gherman Titov,
        rocketed up in a ship almost exactly
        the same. It weighs four and a half
        tons. And it whirls round the Earth

        SIR Bernard Lovell, director
        of Britain's radio telescope,
        was stunned last night at the
        "nonchalant" way the Russians
        had performed their
        latest Space feat.

        He said at Jodrell Bank,
        Cheshire: "It is a natural consequence
        of the Gagarin fight that
        they would want to put up a man
        for a longer period of time.

        "But the absolutely nonchalant
        way they do it is incredible.

        "It underlines the amazing
        scientific and technological advances
        in the Soviet Union.

        "In comparison with the Americans,
        you can guess which country
        appears to be struggling--and it is
        certainly not Russia.

        Sir Bernard added: "It is
        another important step in the Russian
        plan to populate the solar
        system beginning with the invasion
        of the moon in a few years' time.

        "That is, always assuming that
        this man does not suffer any
        unforeseen biological effects from
        his prolonged exposure in outer
        Space."

        Sir Bernard said he was dismayed
        by the number of people
        who had asked him "if Gagarin
        had really gone into orbit."

        "This most striking success will
        demonstrate to such doubters the
        utter folly of their attitude," he
        went on. "It is not only folly, but
        extremely dangerous for the world
        today not to believe these startling
        facts. No country would attempt
        to endanger its reputation by
        attempting such a hoax.

        "I'm far from being pro-Russian
        in the political sense, but I think
        it is one of the greatest dangers
        in the world today to underestimate
        their tremendous strength
        in science and technology."

        Then he warned the West, "I
        said at the time of the Gagarin
        flight that this was an example
        which the West would disregard at
        its peril.

        "I say that the peril is even
        greater today."

        TAMARA, 23, wife of
        Spaceman Titov, at
        first "did not quite
        approve" of his flight.

        Major Titov told Russian
        Premier Krushchev
        this in a personal phone
        call yesterday soon after
        his landing. Their talk
        went like this . . .

        TITOV: I report that the
        task set by the
        Party and the Government
        has been fulfilled.

        MR. K.: Excellent. Your
        voice sounds as
        though you had just
        arrived from a wedding
        feast.

        TITOV: Well said, Nikita
        Sergeyevich.
        There was a feast, but
        not a wedding one.

        MR. K: A wedding feast
        is the happiest
        time for the newly married.
        But what you have
        done---this is a happy
        time for the whole of
        mankind.

        TITOV: Thank you,
        Nikita Sergeyevich.

        MR. K: I kiss you and
        embrace you
        by phone . . . but when
        we meet I'll embrace you
        in a fatherly manner.
        Did you manage to sleep
        during the flight?

        TITOV: I should have
        wakened at two
        o'clock in the morning,
        but woke at 2.35.

        MR. K: That is good.
        It means you
        have a healthy constitution
        if, after strenuous
        work, you can have a
        good rest and make yourself
        wake up when
        needed so as to resume
        your duties.

        You are now no longer
        a candidate member of
        the Party. I reckon that
        your candidate probationary
        period has already
        ended. Because every
        moment of your stay in
        Space can be counted as
        years.

        TITOV: I sincerely thank
        you, Nikita
        Sergeyevich, and I thank
        the Party and the
        Government.

        MR. K: How is your
        wife? She knew
        about your flight?

        TITOV: Yes, she knew.

        MR. K: And did she approve
        of this
        flight?

        TITOV: At first, she did
        not quite approve,
        but later she did.

        MR. K: This is wholly
        understandable.

        # Britain joins search for Venus rocket

        SPACE scientists in
        Russia and Britain are
        to combine in a full-scale
        bid to trace the "lost"
        Venus-bound rocket, it was
        announced last night.

        The scientists in Russia
        will try to switch on the
        radio transmitter in the
        rocket---now estimated to
        be more than 60,000,000
        miles away.

        At the same time, Britain's
        "Space ear," the
        giant radio telescope at
        Jodrell Bank, Cheshire,
        will try to pick up any
        signals sent out by the
        rocket.

        A WOMAN Space expert,
        Soviet Professor Alla Masewitch,
        is at Jodrell Bank
        trying to track down the
        rocket which was launched
        in Russia last February.

        # British rocket shot will help to put chimp in Space

        By RONALD BEDFORD

        A BRITISH rocket roared
        into Space yesterday
        to seek scientific facts for
        the Americans to send a
        chimpanzee into orbit
        soon.

        The 25ft. Skylark rocket---called
        "The Flying
        Drainpipe"---was fired at
        the Woomera range in
        Australia.

        It went 120 miles into
        Space to study altraviolet
        radiation from the
        Sun.

        ## Success

        Mr. Alan Hulme, Australian
        Minister of Supply,
        said in Canberra that the
        shot was made for the
        American Space Agency.

        It was a success. "All
        instruments behaved
        satisfactorily," he said.

        The information gleaned
        will help to assess
        hazards to the chimpanzee,
        which will be sent
        three times round the
        world in the next few
        weeks.

        The chimpanzee's flight
        will be a final rehearsal
        for America's attempt to
        put a man into orbit.

        # December or June safest for that moon trip

        Evening Standard Reporter

        WASHINGTON. Monday.---Best
        time to go to the moon
        is in June or December.

        American scientists who have
        been keeping watch for 11 years
        reported here today that for
        some strange reason radioactivity
        in space drops to its
        lowest in those periods. Men
        who set out during "safe
        months" stand the best chance
        of returning from the moon
        unharmed.

        The finding is of tremendous
        importance for designers now
        at work on the first moonships
        for it means they should not
        need to supply thick protective
        skins as was once believed
        necessary.

        ## Gas blobs

        It is now clear that the sun
        is entirely to blame for sudden
        increases in space radiation.
        When flares occur on its surface,
        huge blobs of radioactive gas
        puff into the heavens and form
        dangerous floating obstacles to
        manned space flight

        But American and Russian
        scientists now claim to be able
        to predict solar flares three to
        four days in advance by noting
        sudden appearance groups of
        black spots on face.

        So it will be possible on three-day
        journeys to the moon to
        give enough warning to astronauts
        to allow them to turn
        their spaceships round to return
        to earth or press on quickly to
        land, so that the moon's bulk
        shields them from approaching
        streams of dangerous radioactive
        sun gas.

        The man whom America has just entrusted with the
        task of getting an American to the Moon does not
        believe it matters if a Russian lands first. "Our task
        is to explore space," he says. "For all its brightness
        Moon is only one part of space. If a Red gets there
        before us we will not stop."

        D. Brainerd Holmes---or
        "Mr. Moon" as newspapers
        here now refer to him---is
        neither politician nor
        scientist but a business
        executive aged just 47.

        Reaching for the moon
        conjurs up with him not a
        vision of huge rockets or
        spacemen but a paper jungle
        of statistic budgets and
        personnel.

        Today Brainerd Holmes'
        downright realism makes an
        interesting contrast to what is
        being called "space crazlest
        week in history."

        One thousand scientists with
        rocket engineers have gathered
        here to trumpet out a most
        impressive "Spacefight Report
        to the Nation".

        ## No choice

        If any American wondered
        why his country has indulged in
        a multi-billion dollar space
        programme he will be left in no
        doubt after this week.

        Holmes puts it like this: "We
        have no choice but to go ahead
        with a space effort of this
        magnitude. It is most unlikely
        we could continue to grow as a
        great world power unless we
        did. You cannot look at it only
        in the light of getting a man
        on the Moon. Benefits will rub
        off on our entire economy---there
        will be advances for
        industry, labour, government
        and public to share."

        ## Costliest

        The Moon programme is the
        biggest and costliest peace-time
        venture ever undertaken by the
        United States, swamping all
        other space research put
        together.

        Holmes---who welded 10,000
        men with scores of contractors
        together so that they delivered
        the West's £350 million ballistic
        missile early warning system on
        time---is only just realising the
        extent of his task.

        ## Loudest noise

        A Moon rocket, for instance,
        is likely to make the loudest
        noise ever heard on Earth,
        requiring an area as big as
        London to be evacuated. It will
        trail an exhaust perhaps 1000ft.
        long and need a firing gantry
        so heavy that it cannot be
        moved.

        Such enormities do not
        frighten "Mr. Moon."

        "When it can all be achieved
        I cannot say until I have looked
        properly at the job," he says.

        "But if instead of having
        people trying to kill each other
        we can turn this particular world
        struggle into peaceful competition
        then whether we get to the
        Moon or not we will have
        achieved something very worthwhile---certainly
        all I could wish
        for."

        # 2 SPACE BIDS THIS WEEK?

        NEW attacks on Space by America AND Russia are expected
        this week. The Americans plan to send a 675lb. robot
        observatory named Ranger II 500,000 miles into Space . . .
        twice as far out as the Moon.

        The Russians may try a Space "spectacular" for the benefit of delegates
        to the Communist Party Congress opening in Moscow tomorrow.

        America's Ranger II will
        not be aimed at the Moon.

        It is expected to orbit for
        fifty days before returning
        to burn up in the Earth's
        atmosphere.

        The Americans also hope
        to carry out a successful
        test with their mightiest
        rocket, Saturn, which has
        been having teething
        troubles.

        British scientists think
        the Russians may be planning:

        1) To send two men into
        Space for between
        three days and a week; or

        2) To send a Spaceship
        on a six-day voyage
        round the Moon with a
        robot observatory aboard,
        and possibly a man as well.

        THE United States is about to move
        into Division One of the Space
        League.

        Until now, the Americans have been
        outshot all along the line in the Space
        race.

        The mighty rocket-boosters developed by
        Russia enabled Soviet scientists to snatch
        Space "firsts" time and time again---first into
        Space, first to the Moon, first to send animals
        into orbit and recover
        them, first to put men
        round the globe and
        bring them back alive.

        Next week, the Americans'
        hopes of catching
        up will be concentrated
        on the launching pad at
        Cape Canaveral, Florida,
        where the mightiest
        rocket seen in the West
        will be ready for blast
        off.

        Name: Saturn.
        Size: Gigantic.

        ## 200 ft Tall

        It makes the Atlas
        rocket, American workhorse
        of Space, look
        puny.

        Saturn is 200ft. tall.
        Atlas, in its heftiest
        version, stands 85ft.

        Saturn will weigh 520
        tons at lift-off. The
        fattest Atlas weighs around
        100 tons.

        Saturn is 22ft. in diameter
        at the base. Atlas
        is 10ft. in diameter.

        Saturn's cluster of eight
        engines will pack a
        blast-off thrust of
        1,500,000lb., compared with
        the 300,000lb. of Atlas.

        The bill for the launching
        devices alone cost
        £15,000,000. Plus another
        £200,000,000 for the complete
        Saturn programme.

        NEXT week's Saturn
        firing will not be
        of the complete assembly.
        Only the booster stage, the
        bottom deck of the mighty
        three-decker, will be "live."

        ## Milestone

        The upper stages will be
        full-weight dummies, without
        motors. Saturn will
        fall into the Atlantic.

        A successful launch will
        mark a major milestone in
        United States history.

        For the full-size Saturn
        could put a ten-ton satellite
        into orbit round the Earth---a
        satellite big enough to
        accommodate three men
        for a fortnight in Space.

        Or it could land a one-ton
        robot laboratory on
        the Moon.

        The Americans are working
        hard to bring off a
        full-scale Saturn firing by
        the end of 1962.

        If next week's test
        succeeds, they could achieve
        a series of Space spectaculars.

        ## Challenge

        Meanwhile, the Russians---who
        have not been idle
        while the Americans have
        been developing Saturn---may
        uncork something
        shattering.

        Such as the blasting into
        orbit of a 60-ton "Space
        train," carrying equipment
        from which a Space station
        could be assembled out in
        the void.

        Mr. Krushchev has
        already hinted that this is
        the Soviet's next objective.

        If it comes off, the
        Americans---even with
        Saturn---will find themselves
        relegated once more
        to the Second Division of
        the Space League.

        # BOYS GIVE THE BRASSHATS A ROCKET

        A ROCKET that every
        child in Britain could
        envy was blasted off yesterday---Guy
        Fawkes eve.

        The 7-ft. 6-in rocket---made
        for £22 10s. by schoolboys
        from coffee tins and
        fuelled by sulphur and zinc---roared
        1,000 ft. into the
        air before returning to
        earth.

        It was a great success and was
        cheered by the boys. But it
        nearly didn't happen. . . .

        Last July the boys, who go
        to Rossall public school, Fleetwood,
        Lancs., were stopped by
        the Home Office from firing the
        rocket in their school grounds
        because of the danger.

        There were protests . . . and
        the Air Ministry agreed to allow
        the boys to use a practice range
        at Cowden, on the east coast.

        Yesterday was the big day.
        Thirty boys went to the range
        with science master Mr. R.
        Bray.

        Also present were rocket-experts
        including one from the
        Farnborough Research Station.

        The count-down was shouted
        by an R.A.F. officer as Mr. Bray
        held the bare leads of the firing
        wires over the terminals of a
        battery.

        On the word "Fire!" he made
        contact.

        For fifteen seconds there was
        silence broken only by groans
        from the boys.

        Suddenly there was a roar
        and the rocket shot into the
        air, a 10-ft. long trail of flame
        behind it.

        As the boys cheered, clapped
        and shouted the rocket went on
        climbing.

        ## Parachute fails

        Then, as it came down, a
        parachute which was supposed
        to bring down a camera, failed.

        The whole rocket crashed to
        the ground. When it was
        found, 600 yards from the firing
        pad, the only part showing
        was the tail fins.

        Comment from one of the
        boffins: "Most spectacular,
        I'm agreeably surprised. But
        I think this will be the first
        and last schoolboy rocket. It
        was not a popular idea with
        the powers that be."

        # U.S. SPACE ROCKET IS A FLOP

        AN American Space
        rocket, launched yesterday
        to try to put a
        satellite into orbit, blew
        up only twenty seconds
        after taking off.

        The 75ft. Blue Scout rocket---which
        exploded at Cape
        Canaveral, Florida---was
        intended to test the
        tracking system of
        America's man-in-Space
        project.

        But officials said, the flop
        will not affect the next
        stage.

        This will be an attempt to
        launch a chimpanzee
        into orbit three times
        round the world later
        this month.

        The chimp's flight is
        planned as the last test
        before a man is launched
        into orbit---possibly in
        December or January.

        TWO top British space experts attacked
        America yesterday for launching
        350,000,000 tiny copper wires into orbit
        around the earth.

        Sir Bernard Lovell, director of the Jodrell Bank
        radio telescope, said it was not a scientific experiment,
        but a project to improve military communications.

        And he feared it might interfere with future radio observations
        of space. It was a stain on America's previously
        untarnished space research programme, he said.

        Professor Fred Hoyle, professor of astronomy and experimental
        philosophy at Cambridge, said bitterly: "The worst
        you can say about it the better.

        ## 'An intellectual crime'

        "A major intellectual crime has been perpetrated. It is
        what I have always felt---the scientists are being used as a
        facade for an essentially military programme."

        Sir Bernard Lovell said the "needles," which will spread
        out into a 25-mile wide belt around the earth, would clutter
        up space and interfere with scientific work.

        The belt of needles---each 7/10th of an inch long and only
        one-third the thickness of a human hair---will be used to
        bounce radio waves back to earth.

        A slight error in the launching
        could mean the needles
        bunching together instead of
        spreading out in orbit.

        Then they could seriously
        interfere with future radio
        observations of the universe.

        ## They'll be back

        The U.S. Air Force launched
        the needles despite strong protests
        from scientists all over
        the world.

        The needles, which altogether
        weighed only 75 lb., were shot
        into space by an Atlas intercontinental
        missile.

        It will take the needles about
        a month to spread out around
        the earth.

        Launched with them was a
        satellite which will be used to
        warn of enemy missile firings.

        The Americans estimate that
        the needles will be useful for
        from two to three years. Then
        they are to fall back
        into the atmosphere.

        IN MOSCOW, the official
        news agency, Tass, denounced
        the experiment as "antiscientific."

        # U.S. 'needle belt' gets slamming

        ONE of Britain's top
        space scientists, Sir
        Bernard Lovell, stepped up
        his attack on America's
        "needle rocket" launching
        when he appeared on ITV
        last night.

        The US "needle rocket"
        was sent up on Saturday.

        It is designed to release
        millions of tiny needles
        which will form a band
        above the earth from
        which radio signals can
        be reflected.

        Many scientists---including
        Sir Bernard, director
        of the Jodrell Bank Radio
        Observatory---have long
        been critical of this project.

        On ITV, Sir Bernard
        said it amounted to a "contamination
        of outer space."

        The critical scientists
        believe that the needle
        belt will hamper astronomical
        observations.

        Despite their opposition,
        America's President Kennedy
        decided to go on with
        the project.

        TESTS on rats have revealed a new and grave danger to
        cosmonauts hurtling through Space. It is the risk of instant
        death or blindness if their capsules collide
        with large specks of Space-dust.

        Now Russian and American Spaceships competing
        in the race to the Moon may have to
        be provided with special "bumpers."

        Scientists at Texas University, led by Dr. Charles Gell,
        put rats into a tiny Spaceship, which was then placed in
        a vacuum tunnel.

        Dust particles were fired
        at the Spageship at tremendous
        speeds.

        The results ranged from
        instant death for one rat,
        when the Spaceship was
        punctured outright, to total
        blindness for other rats
        when the dust particles
        caused a partial explosion
        inside the Spaceship.

        ## Claim

        The scientists claim their
        studies show that a Spaceman
        might be in greater
        danger from a speck of
        dust than from the atomic
        radiation belt in Space---if
        the dust-speck hits his
        ship.

        And they doubt whether,
        if this happened, existing
        Space-suits would offer
        enough protection.

        They have sent their
        report to the American
        National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration, the
        body that controls the
        American man-in-Space
        programme.

        ## Studied

        And they suggest adaptations
        of existing Spaceships
        and Space-suits to
        cope with the risk of a
        Space-dust puncture

        The report is now being
        studied by British scientists.

        # A monkey 6in. tall---named GOLIATH

        By RONALD BEDFORD

        A SIX inches tall, 24
        ounce monkey DIED
        yesterday helping the
        Americans in their mission
        to put more men into
        Space.

        The monkey was "Spaceman"
        Goliath, who seven months ago
        was living happily in the
        Amazon jungle of South
        America.

        After four months' Space training
        Goliath found himself yesterday in
        a Spaceship in the nose of a giant
        Atlas rocket.

        Soon after blast-off from the
        launching pad at Cape Canaveral
        the rocket veered violently off
        course.

        Scientists were near to tears as
        they had to make the emergency
        decision: "Destroy the Atlas---and
        Goliath."

        ## Protests

        There was a danger that the
        Atlas would plunge out of control
        back to the Cape. So a radio signal
        was beamed to the rocket setting off
        an explosive charge.

        When a man is in a Spaceship
        attached to an Atlas, a special
        escape mechanism is fitted to blow
        the ship clear in an emergency.

        But there was no escape mechanism
        for Goliath. . . . He was burned
        to death.

        And last night it was disclosed
        that before the emergency, Goliath,
        a golden squirrel monkey, had been
        sealed in his Spaceship without food
        or water for more than FIFTY-THREE
        hours.

        The blast-off was delayed until
        yesterday.

        Officials at Cape Canaveral said
        last night that plans to put a chimpanzee
        into orbit next week would
        GO ON as planned.

        IN BRITAIN animal organisations
        protested at Goliath's death.

        An RSPCA spokesman said:
        "We shall protest to the American
        Government. It is wrong to expose
        living creatures to the hazards of
        Space travel."

        Mr. Wilfrid Tyldesley, secretary
        of the British Union for the
        Abolition of Vivisection, said: "The
        use of animals for Space experiments
        is unnecessary and a disgrace."

        # 'NO NAME' HAS A DATE---IN SPACE..

        from JOHN EDWARDS

        THE great aerial
        furnace that
        last Friday snuffed
        out the life of Little
        Goliath, the Space
        monkey, had hardly
        finished scorching
        the bushes at Cape
        Canaveral when another
        furry fellow
        was heading towards
        the rocket
        launching pad.

        He is a healthy, grinning
        chimpanzee, four
        years old and welghing
        forty pounds.

        His big moment was due
        at dawn on Tuesday---until
        it was decided, suddenly
        tonight, to delay the rocket
        test.

        When he does take off
        his Space capsule will orbit
        the Earth two or three
        times.

        If things go as planned,
        Space capsule and chimp
        are due to float down into
        the Atlantic and be fished
        out.

        Bon Voyage to our furry
        friend.

        ## NOTHING

        It is a sad thing he has
        no Press agent. We don't
        know anything about him.
        Not even his name.

        All the human American
        Spacemen make
        their trips in a
        blaze of international
        publicity.
        Their personal
        and family lives
        are an open book.

        But about "Mr. No
        Name"---nothing. He is
        being sent to test orbital
        flight before an American
        tackles it. He deserves a
        mention.

        So---probably for the first
        time---"Mr. No Name"
        this is your (more recent)
        life:

        YOU have been
        living for a
        year with four other
        chimps at the Hollowman
        Air Force Base,
        New Mexico.

        ## TASKS

        Your routine has been
        similar to that of the
        human astronauts. You
        have been going to school
        five days a week. You have
        been taught a seventy-minute
        programme of four
        major tasks that you will
        be expected to carry out in
        orbit.

        The programme recycles
        so that at the end of one
        period---approximately one
        earth orbit---you will start
        all over again.

        You have been working
        at a waist-high bench.

        In front of you there was
        a shelf with three levers.
        You were taught how to hit
        the correct lever with your
        hand when one of your
        teachers flashed a particular
        coloured light.

        You have also been
        taught to identify three
        symbols of the same
        pattern. Sometimes the
        teacher handed you two
        symbols---both different
        from the third. Then you
        had to ignore them.

        These tests were designed
        to train you to perform
        the functions of a qualified
        Space chimp as you whizzed
        around the world.

        If you got full marks for
        doing everything correctly,
        they gave you a tiny sip of
        water and a banana
        flavoured pill. When you
        did things wrong, you got
        a tiny electric shock in
        your left foot so that you
        wouldn't do it again.

        The psychologists in
        charge of the laboratory
        say there was not much
        shock treatment, because
        you were a good pupil.

        In between morning and
        afternoon lessons you were
        allowed time to play with
        your friends.

        And there was a nice
        meal waiting---with real
        bananas this time.

        Then came the final tests---physical
        and reaction
        exams. You got top marks,
        which is why you will be
        making that Space trip
        one day soon.

        ## INSIDE..

        If everything else is OK,
        you will have been in the
        capsule for many hours
        already going through last-minute
        drill like a real
        Spaceman.

        Soon, somebody will lean
        inside your capsule, give
        you a pat on the head and
        wish you luck.

        AND that, "Mr.
        No Name," is
        just about all we know
        about you. All, that is,
        until (with any
        luck) you come
        back safely and
        hold the Press
        conference
        Space agency officials
        are arranging for you.

        It's not much to know
        about the being who carries
        with him some of the hopes
        of our future in Space. But
        a great number of people
        will be thinking about him.

        ## TENSION

        I have sat in the tropical
        sun at Cape Canaveral
        watching man blast into
        Space. I know the sickening
        tension of the pre-launch
        moments.

        It will be little different
        for "Mr. No Name." Nobody
        wants anything to happen
        to him.

        Nobody hopes anything
        will happen to him.

        Nobody thinks anything
        will happen to him.

        To be continued. . . .

        From RALPH CHAMPION
        New York, Sunday

        AMERICA'S
        chances of putting
        a man into orbit
        this year slumped
        to zero tonight.

        For next Tuesday's
        attempt to fire a
        chimpanzee three times
        round the Earth has
        been postponed indefinitely.

        The reason, say experts
        at the Cape Canaveral
        launching pad in Florida,
        is a fault in the Space capsule.

        America badly wanted to
        put a man into orbit by the
        end of the year so that the
        record books would show
        that both the US and
        Russia achieved the feat in
        1961.

        The fault means that the
        capsule will have to be removed
        from the top of its
        modified Atlas booster
        rocket.

        And the removal, inspection
        and replacement will
        take at least a week.

        ## Time

        The National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration
        team are determined to go
        ahead with the "chimp
        shot" probably within the
        next ten days.

        But, as it takes six weeks
        or more to prepare for a
        manned shot, leading technicians
        at Cape Canaveral
        say there is not enough
        time left this year.

        Even if the chimpanzee
        is recovered alive, it will
        take several weeks to study
        the data from this experiment
        before a human life
        can be risked.

        ## Divers

        This blow to America's
        Space programme follows
        today's recovery of the
        body of Goliath---the squirrel
        monkey who died in Friday's
        missile shot.

        Divers found Goliath in
        the smashed nose cone of
        an Atlas rocket in the
        Atlantic off Cape
        Canaveral.

        The rocket had to be destroyed
        thirty seconds after
        launching.

        # ALL SET FOR THE MOON

        RUSSIA is planning to send a
        man round the moon and
        back in the New Year, said a
        report from Moscow yesterday.

        The man has already been
        chosen and his space ship
        built. It is now on its launching
        ground ready to be rocketed
        off on the five-day flight.

        AMERICA yesterday had two
        setbacks in the moon race. Two
        rockets were blasted off successfully,
        but failed to complete
        their scheduled flights.

        # SPACE RIDDLE

        AMERICAN scientists were
        last night investigating reports
        that Russia launched a
        three-man spaceship three
        weeks ago---and lost it. They
        think the spaceship may have
        left its 300-mile-high orbit

        # America plans a fantastic shooting match in Space

        by RONALD BEDFORD

        UNITED STATES Space scientists
        are getting ready for the most
        spectacular shooting-match in history.
        The contest is between two mighty
        missiles.

        THE PLAN: One missile, travelling at 5,000
        m.p.h., will attempt to knock out the other
        missile, heading towards it at 12,000 m.p.h.

        THE BATTLEGROUND:
        The emptiness
        of Space about 200
        miles above the Pacific
        Ocean.

        THE DATE: Early in
        the New Year.

        Missile One is the 100-ton
        Atlas rocket, the
        H-bomb carrying frontline
        weapon of the US
        arsenal.

        ## CLAIM

        Missile Two is the
        twenty-ton Nike-Zeus
        rocket, which, it is
        claimed, can destroy
        enemy H-rockets in
        Space, before they reach
        their intended targets.

        The shooting match
        will put these claims to
        the test---and determine
        the future of Nike-Zeus.

        Already, nearly
        £300,000,000 has been
        spent in an attempt to
        develop a rocket that
        can destroy incoming
        rockets.

        The coming contest has
        all the ingredients of the
        finest science-fiction---missile
        against missile,
        robot "eyes" against
        robot "brains."

        Early in the New Year,
        without any advance
        warning, an Atlas
        will blast off from a
        launch-pad at the
        Vandenberg base 200 miles
        north of Hollywood, California.
        It will be aimed to
        land, at the end of a
        thirty-minute flight, in the
        Pacific close to the coral
        island of Kwajalein.

        But Kwajalein will not,
        it hopes, be caught napping.

        On the 600-acre island,
        United States Army engineers
        and scientists have
        put up a fantastic array of
        equipment. Already the
        bill has reached the
        £30,000,000 mark.

        THERE IS a triangular
        radar antenna, 80ft. wide,
        that looks like a grotesque
        sea-monster, whirling
        ceaselessly round.

        THERE IS a 65ft.-high
        fence to keep people, and
        birds, away from the
        radar's high-energy beam.

        THERE IS a long metal
        tunnel, also for protection,
        through which the scientists
        and engineers walk to
        get from outside the safety-fence
        into the control
        building.

        The energy that the big
        radar, called ZAR (Zeus
        Acquisition Radar), pours
        out is utilised to hang an
        invisible curtain thousands
        of miles out in Space.

        Once an incoming rocket
        passes through this
        curtain, ZAR is
        alerted for trouble.

        It passes on the
        information it receives to
        a "little brother" radar
        called Teeter (Target
        Tracking Radar).

        ## BRAINY!

        Teeter has the job
        of pinpointing the incoming
        missile, locking on
        to it, working out its speed
        and impact point, and
        deciding whether it has a
        nuclear warhead aboard,
        or whether it is just a
        decoy.

        Teeter feeds all the
        information into an electronic
        brain. This works
        out the point at which the
        incoming missile can best
        be intercepted for destruction.

        It sets the fuses of the
        warhead on a Nike-Zeus
        missile waiting on a
        launch-pad. And it presses
        the firing-button at the
        precise moment needed for
        a perfect interception.

        ## ALL-ROBOT

        And all this is done electronically,
        as no human
        brain could cope with the
        split-second decisions
        needed.

        ORIGINALLY,
        the plan for
        next year's shooting-match
        was to send up
        Nike-Zeus armed only
        with special radars and
        split-second cameras.

        These would have
        worked out the nearness to
        the Atlas achieved by the
        Nike-Zeus, crediting it
        with a "kill" if it got
        within a secret distance.

        But the Soviet resumption
        of nuclear tests last
        September, and Russia's
        claim to have perfected an
        anti-missile missile, will
        change this.

        ## PATTERN

        President Kennedy is
        being pressed to authorise
        the use of a small nuclear
        warhead for the Nike-Zeus---to
        show, beyond any
        doubt, it it achieves a
        "kill."

        Next year's shooting-match
        will also set the
        pattern of Space-war---with
        nuclear-tipped rockets
        being launched to blast
        out of Space H-bomb carrying
        satellites orbiting the
        globe at 18,000 mph.

        ENOS, the champion Space chimp, landed safely in the
        Atlantic tonight after soaring twice round the world at
        17,500 m.p.h.

        It was an emergency landing. Three orbits were planned. But the
        trip was dramatically cut short by US Space scientists at Cape Canaveral
        when the Space capsule's mechanism overheated.

        The capsule, blasted 130 miles Into Space by a 100-ton Atlas
        rocket, was streaking across the Pacific towards the end of
        its second orbit when ground controlrecording machines signalled
        that something was wrong.

        US Space Agency officials immediately
        decided to halt the flight.

        They beamed special radio signals
        to the capsule, guiding it gently over
        America and out over the Atlantic.

        The capsule fell into the sea on
        the end of a parachute, 220 miles
        south of Bermuda, and was picked
        up by a patrolling ship.

        Enos was "chattering wildly" when he
        was released, the rescuers reported, but he
        seemed "quite normal" otherwise.

        Enos---weight 38lb., height 3ft. 2in.,
        aged 5½---was the first animal to be
        put in orbit by America.

        His task was to blaze the trail for the
        first manned orbital flight---before the end
        of the year.

        Enos made the trip zipped into a
        Space-suit, and strapped down in a plastic
        cradle.

        As he soared through Space, he obeyed
        various commands flashed to him by
        coloured lights, by pulling a series of
        levers.

        If he failed to obey,
        or pulled the wrong lever,
        he got a slight electric
        shock.

        Eighteen tracking stations
        dotted round the
        globe kept a close watch on
        the flight---and the chimp's
        reactions.

        They found that his reactions
        were not affected by
        weightlessness, or by the
        shock of the take-off.

        A Space Agency official
        said later: "The chimp
        didn't miss a single trick.
        It was a very successful
        flight."

        The overheating, he
        added, could have been
        corrected if there had been
        a man in the capsule.

        A CHIMP pathfinding
        for America's first
        man into orbit was
        snatched from space today
        when its capsule went
        wrong.

        The capsule was brought
        down into the sea after it
        completed two out of three
        scheduled orbits of the earth.

        Warships picked it up 500
        miles south of Bermuda.

        The chimp, a five-year-old
        named Enos, was in good shape
        after three hours in space and
        an hour in the water.

        ## THE WAIT

        For six hours before blast-off
        this morning, Enos lay in baby's
        nappie and white nylon suit
        strapped in a mummy-like case
        atop a 93ft. Atlas rocket.

        Nineteen seconds before zero
        there was a hitch. But soon
        afterwards the rocket went like
        an arrow, through wispy cloud
        over Canaveral and flung its
        capsule into orbit over Bermuda.

        Enos was on his own now.

        At nearly 18,000 miles an hour
        the capsule sailed 150 miles high
        over the Canary Islands, over
        West Africa (where Enos was
        born), over Zanzibar, over
        Australia.

        "All well," said reports.

        ## THE FAULT

        The capsule reappeared over
        Mexico, then completed the first
        orbit in 92 minutes.

        The second orbit went like a
        clock until the last 20 minutes.
        Then trouble.

        The space-ship was overheating
        due to an electrical fault
        and veering off course. The men
        watching the dials far below
        switched in the retro-rockets and
        brought Enos plunging earthwards.

        Parachutes opened. The capsule
        plopped into the sea. Rescue
        ships moved in. The chimp was
        safe.

        One man in particular watched
        every move---John Glenn, a
        cool, 40-year-old Marine colonel.

        Just before Christmas he is
        expected to become America's
        first man in orbit---thanks to
        Enos and despite today's snag.

        ENOS, the five-year-old
        American space-chimp,
        was picked up
        safely in the Atlantic today
        after his space capsule
        ran into trouble during
        the second of three
        planned orbits of the
        earth.

        The U.S. destroyer Stormes
        plucked Enos from the sea 220
        miles south-east of Bermuda.
        Doctors aboard the ship
        opened the capsule and removed
        the special cradle holding
        the 37½lb. chimpanzee.
        They reported: "He looks
        normal to us."

        Enos was hurtling over the
        Pacific towards America's west
        coast at 17,500 m.p.h. when signals
        from the capsule warned
        Cape Canaveral technicians that
        something was wrong.

        ## Doubts

        His intended third circuit was
        immediately abandoned and
        reverse rockets were fired by
        radio from California to tug the
        capsule gently back from space
        in a long glide across America.

        The capsule, which parachuted
        down, touched the ocean at 1.28
        p.m., just three hours and 21
        minutes after it rode on a 125-ton
        Atlas rocket into the blue Florida
        skies.

        The Stormes and a sister
        destroyer, the Compton, steamed
        at full speed towards the bobbing
        chimp, who went on pulling levers
        merrily to let everyone know he
        was still alive and kicking after
        his hair-raising trip.

        What went wrong? Officials
        said an inverter in the cockpit
        which changes power from direct
        to alternating current had overheated.

        But they said that a man could
        have corrected the malfunctioning
        rocket with a turn of a switch.

        Although Enos came through
        his ordeal, the flight raised doubts
        as to whether the intended crash
        programme designed to get an
        American astronaut in orbit
        before the end of the year will
        now be mounted. It was dependent
        on complete success of the
        chimp-shot.

        Chimp and capsule were taken
        to Bermuda for preliminary
        examination. They will then be
        returned to Cape Canaveral.

        ## A comic

        Earlier, the scientists at
        Canaveral had cheered as Enos
        whirled over the cape after blasting
        off from the concrete pad 120
        miles beneath.

        Cheerfully the space ape was
        pulling levers on the control panel
        for a reward of banana pellets.
        His first orbit lasted 88½ minutes.

        Enos was in fine form. The
        Project Mercury control centre at
        Canaveral, in touch with all
        tracking stations, said "This ape
        isn't missing a trick."

        His altitude ranged from 146 to
        99 miles. A tape recording broadcast
        voice messages from his
        cabin.

        Enos, a native of the French
        Cameroons, is a comic, clown-faced
        chimp. Through his
        rocket ride he reclined, freshly
        shaven and in a nylon jacket,
        upon a fibre-glass couch.

        Space note: Ham, America's
        first ape in space, was also
        scheduled to make the flight. But
        three days ago at Canaveral he
        rifled a box of biscuits and ate
        himself out of the trip.

        AMERICA last night named her No. 1
        choice for her first MANNED orbital
        Space flight.

        He is LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN
        GLENN, 39, of the US Marines. His "backup
        man," or stand-by, will be Commander
        M. Scott Carpenter, of the US Navy.

        The first choice for the second manned
        orbital Space flight, said Mr. Robert Gilruth,
        Director of the man-in-Space project,
        would be Major Donald Slayton, with Commander
        Walter Schirra as his stand-in.

        This leaves out America's first two
        astronauts---Commander Alan Shepard
        and Captain Virgil Grissom---who both
        made straight-up-and-down flights earlier
        this year.

        Shepard was named yesterday as
        "technical adviser" for the Glenn-Carpenter
        team. Grissom will play the
        same role on flight
        No. 2.

        Mr. Gilruth said the
        selections did not necessarily
        mean that there
        would not be further tests
        with animals before
        manned flights.

        But, he said, he would be
        "ready to go" on a manned
        flight before the end of
        the year.

        Glenn, who is married,
        with two children, is the
        oldest of the seven selected
        astronauts.

        He joined the Marines in
        1943 and flew fifty-nine
        combat missions in World
        War II, mainly in the Pacific.

        He has more than 5,100
        hours of flying time, and
        has been awarded the distinguished
        Flying Cross
        five times.

        "I am very happy about
        this choice of team," he
        said yesterday. "Scott and
        I work well together."

        SCIENTISTS will begin to design a British-manned Spaceship
        in the New Year under a big shake-up in the nation's
        Space research programme.

        The shake-up has been ordered by Mr. Peter Thorneycroft, the Minister
        of Aviation. Beginning on January 1 the country's Space research
        resources will be streamlined
        under the overall
        direction of the Royal
        Aircraft Establishment
        at Farnborough, Hants.

        Main aim is to prepare
        Britain's part in the new
        European Space Research
        Organisation (ESRO)
        and its counterpart, the
        European Launcher
        Development Organisation
        (ELDO).

        ## Cost

        Britain's contribution to
        ESRO and ELDO will
        cost the taxpayer an estimated
        £25,000,000 over the
        next five years.

        The Royal Aircraft Establishment
        will have three
        main units under the reshuffle:

        * The Space Development
        Department. This will
        be headed by Dr. Albert
        Lines, 47, a soft-spoken six-footer
        who is one of the
        country's top radar specialists.

        The main job of the
        department will be to
        advance Britain's highly
        successful Black Knight
        and Skylark research
        rockets and to ensure that
        Blue Streak is properly used
        as the main booster for the
        ESRO programme.

        * The Weapons Department.
        In charge will be
        Dr. Dennis John ("Joe")
        Lyons, a leading rocket
        specialist. He will develop
        new air-to-air, air-to-ground
        and ground-to-air
        rockets.

        * The Instrumentation
        and Ranges Department.
        This will be headed
        by ruddy-cheeked Dr.
        Robert Pye, who will control
        Britain's four rocket
        test ranges.

        ## Forward

        Yesterday, Sir Bernard
        Lovell, director of Jodrell
        Bank radio astronomy station,
        gave his Space predictions
        for 1962.

        He said: "I predict that
        1962 will be a year when
        instruments will be
        landed on the moon's surface.
        This will be a very
        exciting step forward."

        # U.S. ON MOON BY 1965

        * America is planning to
        build a 3,000-ton Spaceship
        which will put a man
        on the Moon by 1965, Dr.
        Wernher von Braun, the
        top US rocket expert, said
        yesterday.

        * The power plant will be
        a boosted-up version of
        the Saturn rocket---first
        launched last October.

        * Cost of the project---which
        will put America
        level with the Russians in
        the Moon race---will be
        £890,000,000.

        Cape Canaveral, Florida, Monday

        AMERICA'S man-in-orbit
        shot,
        scheduled for Wednesday,
        has been put
        off until Saturday.

        Early today, faults
        were found in the
        breathing apparatus of
        the Spaceship in which
        Marine Colonel John
        Glenn is due to make
        three orbits of the
        Earth.

        At first, the shot was
        postponed for twenty-four
        hours. Then it was decided
        to make a thorough check
        of the system feeding
        oxygen to Colonel Glenn's
        Spacesuit.

        Later, the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration
        announced that the
        launching was scheduled
        for "not earlier than Saturday."

        The official announcement
        said this would give
        engineers time to correct
        "technical difficulties."

        ## Strain

        Another reason for the
        extra delay is that on
        Friday the Americans plan
        to launch a gold-plated
        Ranger III robot Spaceship
        on a sixty-six-hour
        trip to the Moon.

        This shot is so complex
        that instruments here
        cannot handle both Ranger
        and Glenn on the same day.

        The new setbacks are
        bound to put a big strain
        on 40-year-old Glenn.

        But he certainly showed
        no sign of it when I saw
        him walking about the
        Cape in his Spacesuit this
        afternoon, his portable air-conditioning
        unit tucked
        under his arm.

        Asked how he felt, he
        grinned through his helmet
        face-piece and replied: "I
        feel fine."

        Glenn, father of two, is
        unlikely to go home to his
        family while the Spaceship
        Friendship 7 is being got
        ready for its 18,000 mph
        flight.

        It is planned to bring the
        Spaceship safely down in
        the Atlantic south-east of
        Bermuda.

        # NEW RUSSIAN MOON SHOT?

        HEAVY traffic on Russia's
        radio frequency for space
        satellites yesterday---reported by
        West Germany's Bochum laboratory---started
        speculation on a
        new moon shot.

        The frequency had been
        silent for eight days.

        Washington,
        Wednesday.

        THE first live
        Space TV programme
        may be
        flashed from
        America to Britain
        soon.

        It will almost certainly
        feature President
        Kennedy with a
        "hands across
        Space" message for
        British firesides.

        And, if all goes
        well, Americans will
        see Prime Minister
        Macmillan returning
        the compliment.

        ## Bounce

        Such a venture is
        planned by the giant
        American Telephone
        and Telegraph Company
        in a £10,000,000
        attempt to flash the
        first live TV programme
        across the
        Atlantic by "bouncing"
        signals off
        satellite.

        The company plans
        to put up its first
        TV satellite---the
        Telestar---in April or
        May. It will weigh
        125lb., be crammed
        with electronic gear
        and will orbit at between
        600 and 3,000
        miles.

        The Telestar will be
        able to transmit for
        about ten minutes to
        London. Britain's
        receiving station, now
        being erected by the
        Post Office in Cornwall,
        will be ready in
        the spring.

        ## Costs

        The AT and T
        Company with its
        eye on the future, is
        carrying all costs of
        the Telestar experiment,
        including buying
        the launching
        rockets from the
        American Government
        and paying
        launching costs.

        But if Telestar
        should be a success,
        then it will start
        looking for profits.

        Is it wise that a
        new field of Space
        communications
        should be farmed out
        to a private company?
        Doubts are
        being voiced in the
        US Congress.

        LAST NIGHT the BBC confirmed that
        transatlantic TV experiments will be conducted
        by America with Post Office help.

        # 'Win or bust' rocket tests

        By Science Editor
        RONALD BEDFORD

        BRITAIN'S part in the first
        "live" launching of the Skybolt
        H-rocket began in Florida
        yesterday.

        Two-hundred RAF men and
        British scientists will be working
        with Americans at the huge US air
        base at Eglin, on the Gulf of
        Mexico.

        Scientists on both sides of the
        Atlantic are confident Skybolt will
        prove a winner. It had better. This
        is the missile which persuaded the
        Government to scrap Britain's own
        H-Bomb rocket, Bluestreak, after
        £90,000,000 had been spent on it.

        ## £100,000,000

        Skybolt is being developed for
        joint use by American and RAF
        bombers. The Americans are footing
        the bill for development---estimated
        at around £100,000,000.

        Britain will buy Skybolts "off the
        peg" at an undisclosed cost.

        RAF Vulcan bombers will carry
        two---one under each wing.

        Skybolt is dropped like a bomb.
        Then its motors fire within seconds
        and the 33ft. long rocket roars off at
        10,000 mph towards the target---more
        than 1,000 miles from the
        dropping-point.

        ## Attractive

        The weapon's destructive force
        equals 2,000,000 tons of TNT.

        Why was it so attractive to the
        British Government that they were
        willing to write off the investment
        in Bluestreak ?

        Mainly because Skybolt can be
        fired from aircraft. Bluestreak had
        to be fired from a fixed base, highly
        vulnerable to retaliation.

        Vulcans can
        cruise around,
        outside enemy
        territory, until
        the need to fire.
        They can refuel
        in the air.

        The Government
        has
        taken a big
        gamble with
        Skybolt. If it
        succeeds, the
        retention of the
        manned bomber,
        using air-launched
        rockets,
        will enable
        us to carry on as
        a nuclear power
        able to deliver
        a nuclear blow.

        If Skybolt
        fails, the
        Government
        must either admit
        its defence
        policy is a flop
        or buy from the
        Americans any
        missile they care
        to sell us.

        # MOON SHOT POSTPONED

        From RONALD BEDFORD
        Washington, Friday.

        AN American attempt to
        send a television-carrying
        Spaceship to the
        Moon on Monday was put
        off indefinitely today.

        The postponement was
        due to faults in the 100-ton
        Atlas rocket which was to
        have blasted the gold-and-silver-plated
        Spaceship
        from the launching pad at
        Cape Canaveral, Florida.

        Discovery of the faults is
        a tremendous blow to the
        United States.

        For a similar Atlas rocket
        is scheduled to carry
        40-year-old US Colonel
        John Glenn into Space on
        Wednesday for a three-times-round-the-world
        trip.

        With the Moon shot and
        the Glenn mission, next
        week was to have been the
        most exciting in American
        Space history.

        But news of the Moon
        shot postponement brought
        a deep depression.

        And some superstitious
        officials are now pointing
        out that the engineering
        drawings for Glenn's two-ton,
        bell-shaped Spaceship
        are labelled "Space Craft
        No. 13."

        Russian scientists are now preparing a gigantic assault
        on the moon. It will have four main stages. And the
        first step is likely to be taken early in the New Year---possibly
        in January.

        Target date for a cosmonaut to set foot on
        the planet is 1964---perhaps three years earlier
        than any American is expected.

        British experts are now convinced of these
        things after a careful analysis of recent Soviet
        scientific literature, and from reports from
        behind the Iron Curtain.

        The key to Russia's master plan to be first
        on the Moon was undoubtedly her series of
        rocket trials in the Pacific two months ago.
        Eight rockets were fired.

        ## THE CLIP-ON BOOSTER

        British scientists are now sure this was a double test
        of one rocket---made up of four boosters which can be
        "married up" in space to form a fully-fuelled Moonship.

        This marrying-up---a fresh section can be launched
        from Russia and clipped on to the spacecraft every time
        it whirls over in orbit---is called "space rendezvous."

        It has never been tried. British experts believe it
        will be shortly. It would mark a tremendous breakthrough.

        The "space rendezvous" technique should enable
        Russia to short-cut construction of monster Moonships
        which---if they had to be launched from Earth with
        enough fuel to bring a crew of cosmonauts safely back---would
        have to weigh anything between 1000 and 3000
        tons.

        ## THERE AND BACK---BY DOGS

        The other main stages in the Soviet plan are thought
        to be:

        1---EXPLORATION of the Moon's dusty surface to find
        a safe landing area.

        2---ORBITING of the Moon 240,000 miles away and
        re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere with dogs---living
        for nearly a week in the prototype of a cabin
        designed for men.

        3---The first MANNED LANDING, timed if possible for
        1964. In that year gas activity on the Sun---which
        directly influences the radiation hazard in space---is due
        to reach a minimum.

        Exploration of the sterile satellite---it has virtually
        no atmosphere, a gravity only one sixth as strong as
        Earth's, and a layer of dust over much of its face---is
        high on the list of Russian priorities.

        Soviet scientists claim to have developed a system
        of telemetring high definition TV close-ups over huge
        distances. These should indicate danger spots in the
        Moon's terrain.

        Rare detail is also given in a report to the Academy
        of Sciences in Moscow, which has reached the West, by
        a leading Russian space scientist named as Professor
        Georgi V. Petrovich.

        He points out that when rockets touch gently down
        on to the Moon their exhausts will shatter and melt the
        surface. The inspection vehicle will therefore crawl---"a
        few dozen metres from the rocket, or if the surface is
        covered with dust, a few hundred metres before making
        its probes."

        The Russians are known to have developed a
        technique of remotely controlling a rocket from Earth
        with a high degree of accuracy. So an intensive survey
        of the Moon by "automatic laboratories" presents
        comparatively few technical problems.

        It will certainly start next year.

        ## A 'CRASH' PROGRAMME

        The mighty boosters which launched cosmonauts
        Gagarin and Titov into orbit around the world were
        capable of sending dogs to the Moon and back NOW.
        But British scientists expect the Russians to wait until
        they have perfected the technique and "ship" they
        will use for manned flight before sending dogs.

        Every report to date suggests that Russian lunar
        flights will be completely automatic. The crew's chief
        function will be to explore and observe.

        Many problems remain to be solved.

        The outstanding one worrying Soviet doctors is:
        "Will spacemen all be as sick as Gherman Titov?" For
        medical data later showed the Soviet pilot was nauseated
        for most of his 25 hours in orbit. So more tests of
        cosmonauts during long periods of "weightlessness" will
        be carried out in 1962.

        But British experts believe the Russians are
        delighted with the behaviour of their new rockets and
        will now press ahead with a "crash" programme which
        will once more startle the world.

        TENSION is mounting here on Rocket Row. The
        last hours are ticking away to the countdown
        for the dizziest, busiest, whizziest week in
        America's Space history books.

        By Friday night, if all goes well, more rockets, missiles,
        satellites and Space ships will have been
        fired from here than in any week since
        the Space Age dawned in 1957.

        And Americans, boosted by the hip-hooray
        and ballyhoo they love, are wild with excitement
        at the prospect

        This thrilling week is due to begin on Wednesday.

        ## Shepherding

        Marine Colonel John Glenn, who has enough
        boisterous enthuslasm at the age of forty to go
        into orbit almost without a rocket, will climb
        into a phone-booth-sized Space ship . . . and
        attempt to orbit the Earth three times and return
        to talk about it.

        Already the gaudy motels which nestle near
        the sands fringing the Space base are packed.

        Reporters, photographers, TV men, radio commentators,
        scientists, missilemen, and honest-to-goodness
        spectators, are as thick as flies on the ground.

        Cape Canaveral police
        cars, sirens wailing, patrol
        like wary collies, shepherding
        sightseers here
        and there and clearing
        the road to the Space base
        for priority traffic.

        ## Safety

        All these people, along
        with the rest of America,
        will be praying for a safe
        take-off by the Atlas
        rocket powering Glenn's
        Mercury Space ship. . .
        And a safe return.

        Television will follow
        every move, from the
        moment Glenn puts on his
        silver Space suit to the
        awe-inspiring moment
        when the 100-ton rocket
        blasts slowly off the
        launch-pad.

        America's scientists need
        the know-how which
        Glenn's flight alone can
        provide for the design of
        their Gemini two-man
        Space ship.

        America is prepared to
        spend £50,000,000 building
        a fleet of Geminis to enable
        men to stay in orbit
        for a week or more.

        ## Memory

        The first Gemini flight
        is planned for late 1963.

        Glenn's Space trip is
        also closely tied up with
        the Apollo project, designed
        to take three men
        to the Moon for one orbit
        before returning to Earth.

        Russia has handled all
        the Space "spectaculars"
        up to now.

        But as Space week begins
        Americans remember
        that of thirty-four satellites
        in orbit, thirty-three
        are American: and of
        seventy-five major Space-launches
        that succeeded,
        sixty-two were American.

        ## Secrecy

        Like scientists here, I
        feel that the whole Space
        week has been surrounded
        by too much hip-hooray
        and ballyhoo.

        But I must admit that
        the open-handed American
        methods are to be preferred
        to the methods of
        the Russians . . . who
        handle Space shots in the
        deepest secrecy.

        # My comment . .

        AMERICANS do beat the big drum in advance.
        But if there is a slip-up this week at least
        they will be honest enough to grin and have
        another go . . . still before the eyes of the world.

        # ANOTHER TRY AT MOON

        THERE are two other
        highlights of
        America's great Space
        week following John
        Glenn's attempt on
        Wednesday to orbit the
        Earth.

        * On Thursday a 53-ton
        Thorablestar rocket
        will blast off with four
        Navy satellites and one
        Army satellite.

        ## Gold

        Five hundred miles up,
        the satellites will be
        ejected from the rocket
        one by one.

        * On Friday the most
        ambitious attempt of
        all is due.

        America will try to rocket
        a television-carrying
        gold and silver-plated
        Space ship on a sixty-six
        hour journey to the
        Moon, more than
        238,000 miles away.

        This attempt was due to
        be made today.

        But faults were found in
        the Atlas rocket.

        So, as a wave of disappointment
        swept
        America, the attempt
        was postponed.

        ON the eve of his
        space flight today
        Lt.-Col. John
        Glenn appealed to
        America to continue
        space probes---even
        if he should die.

        Despite this single
        grim note, the 40-year-old
        astronaut was reported
        to be in good
        spirits, in top physical
        condition, calm, confident
        and eager to go.

        At 12.30 p.m. GMT today
        he is scheduled to be hurled
        into space to become the
        first American to orbit the
        earth.

        ## RISK

        The marine colonel's appeal
        was relayed to reporters
        by Lt.-Col John A.
        Powers. the astronaut's
        personal spokesman.

        He said Col. Glenn had
        brought it up in conversation
        that he hoped reporters
        understood the
        complexity of his mission.

        "He wants you to understand,"
        Col. Powers added,
        "that he and we have reduced
        the risk as far as
        humanly possible but that
        there is still risk. He recognises
        the risk, that there
        could be a malfunction,
        that something could happen
        ti him."

        If anything went wrong
        he could be in space for ten
        days---with only 24 hours'
        supply of oxygen. His craft
        would slowly return into
        the atmosphere.

        Weather conditions at Cape
        Canaveral for Col. Glenn's space
        flight to-morrow looked good today.
        Lt.-Col. John Powers, the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration spokesman, emphasised
        the risks of the flight.

        Col. Powers said that barring
        unforeseen launching difficulties,
        or problems during actual flight,
        Col. Glenn would probably make
        three orbits if launched at 12.30
        p.m., two orbits if launched after
        2.30 p.m. and one if launched
        after 4 p.m.

        ## MENTIONED BY TASS

        Tass, the official Russian news
        agency, reported the American moon
        shot attempt last night. It gave brief
        details of the spacecraft and its
        mission.---BUP.

        # Will he have to do THIS today?

        by
        RONALD
        BEDFORD

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Friday.

        A LONELY man in a big swivel chair may have to blow up
        Spaceman John Glenn's Atlas rocket within thirty seconds
        of blast-off tomorrow.

        All he has to do is lean forward and punch a jampot-sized red
        button marked
        "destruct," and as
        soon as he does---

        * The Space capsule
        carrying Glenn will
        be ejected from the
        rocket;

        * The rocket will explode
        into a great
        flaming torch as its
        highly inflammable fuel
        ignites.

        Thirty-eight-year-old
        Major Winton Hammond,
        a six-footer from
        the Mid-West, is the
        lonely man who faces a
        momentous decision.

        He is "Destruct
        Officer"
        here, and his
        job is to look
        out for the
        safety of 20,000
        workers on the
        base and 10,000
        other people who live
        nearby.

        With their safety in
        mind, Hammond alone
        has the responsibility
        for destroying the rocket
        during its first thirty
        seconds in the air when
        it could be a danger to
        the base.

        And not even President
        Kennedy can question
        his decision.

        On average, one rocket
        in ten is destroyed
        during the early stage of
        launching.

        HAMMOND has
        an unemotional
        approach to his big
        task.

        He told me: "There is
        a special escape system
        on Atlas which
        will get the
        Spacecraft
        clear if I have
        to destruct.

        "In tests it
        has worked perfectly.
        There is nothing I can
        do to endanger Glenn if
        I have to destroy Atlas."

        ## RELY

        He added: "After you
        have destroyed a rocket
        you often wonder
        whether you've overlooked
        something.

        "But you have to rely
        on your own judgment.
        Even after a destruct I
        don't have any difficulty
        sleeping."

        Like Glenn, Hammond
        is married and has two
        teenage children. He
        has been safety officer
        since the dawn of
        America's Space Age.

        ## DRAWL

        He was on duty when
        the first US Sputnik
        blew up on the launchpad
        here.

        In a soft drawl, reminiscent
        of Chester, Marshall
        Dillon's sidekick in
        the TV programme
        "Gunsmoke," he told
        me: "I have met Spaceman
        Glenn only twice---once

        # New U.S. Space shot on course

        Cape Canaveral, Florida, Saturday

        A GLITTERING, gold-and-silver-plated American
        Spaceship is heading today for the Moon
        and doing fine.

        The Spaceship Ranger Three, carrying TV cameras and
        other instruments, was launched on the nose of a 100ft. long
        Atlas-Agena double rocket last night.

        And Ranger Three---11ft. long, weighing 727lb.---got away
        dead on time for her journey through 235,000 miles of cold,
        silent emptiness.

        The velvet-smooth launching of Ranger Three came during
        the count-down for today's trip by American Marine Colonel
        John Glenn, who is due to be
        whisked round the world three times
        in a two-ton Spaceship.

        ## 'Coasting'

        DEAD ON TIME, the white twin
        rocket roared off Launching Pad
        Twelve, a mile from where I stood
        watching.

        DEAD ON TIME, five minutes after
        launching, the 78ft.-long Atlas
        rocket burned out.

        For half a minute, the whole assembly
        "coasted." Then...

        DEAD ON TIME, explosive charges
        blasted the dead Atlas shell from the
        22ft. Agena rocket and her Spaceship
        load.

        DEAD ON TIME, the Agena's
        motors opened up for a 150-second
        burst that took it to a speed of 1,800
        miles an hour. Then . . .

        DEAD ON TIME, the motors shut
        off for another four minutes of
        "coasting" which was planned to
        position the Agena's passenger for
        the final blast.

        ## Tension

        Then came thirty-five minutes of
        agonised tension as Cape Canaveral
        waited for word of the Agena's
        "second burn."

        But at last, America's National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        announced:

        "Ranger Three is on her way to the
        Moon. She is on approximately the
        correct trajectory."

        With a parting 23,800
        m.p.h. boost from the
        Agena, the gleaming Spaceship
        curved away on the
        S-shaped course which, it is
        hoped, will get her to the
        Moon on Monday afternoon---about
        sixty-six hours
        after the launching.

        As the Spaceship was set
        free from the Agena, she
        spread insect-like "wings"---solar-power
        cells to help
        steer by the sun.

        In a fantastically difficult
        series of manoeuvres,
        Ranger Three must---

        TWIST once, to angle
        her power-cell paddles at
        the sun;

        TWIST a second time to
        point her radio antenna at
        the Earth, for steering instructions,
        and---

        TWIST AGAIN when
        she gets to within 5,000
        miles of the Moon, so that
        television cameras aboard
        are pointed at her target.

        The cameras will be
        switched on by a signal
        from an 85ft.-diameter
        radio-telescope at Goldstone,
        California.

        ## Pictures

        At 2,400 miles from the
        Moon, the cameras will
        start sending pictures back
        to Earth . . . one picture
        every fifteen seconds.

        When the Spaceship is
        just fifteen miles and
        eight seconds from the
        Moon's surface, a white
        instrument-package,
        shaped like an Eskimo
        igloo, will be blasted free.

        Brake-rockets will start
        up, slowing the "igloo"
        from 6,000 m.p.h to 150
        m.p.h. for its landing on the
        Moon

        As the "igloo" slows,
        the rest of the Ranger
        Spaceship will hurtle past,
        and wipe itself out in a
        crash-landing.

        Although the Ranger
        will be destroyed, she has
        been sterilised to avoid
        taking Earth germs to the
        Moon.

        So has the "igloo"
        package.

        After a rough landing on
        the Moon's surface, its instruments
        will start bleeping
        back information about
        "moonquakes"---the equivalent
        of earthquakes.

        WHERE on the Moon Is
        the Space-shot expected to
        land?

        "No particular spot," a
        scientist told me. "We'll
        be glad to hit the Moon at
        all."

        As Ranger Three heads
        into deep Space today she
        is being tracked by two
        radio stations in South
        Africa and one in Australia,
        as well as the
        station at Goldstone,
        California.

        Britain's huge radio
        telescope at Jodrell Bank,
        Cheshire, was joining in
        the operation in the early
        hours today.

        But because of the direction
        in which Ranger Three
        was launched, the Jodrell
        Bank team will be unable
        to keep track of her as they
        did with Russia's Lunik
        Two, which hit the Moon
        in 1959.

        # "NOMINAL FLIGHT" Launching "Flawless"

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration announced
        40 minutes later that the launching
        vehicle had performed flawlessly.

        A deep space tracking station in
        South Africa had traced the spacecraft.
        "It appears we have a nominal
        (normal) flight," the announcement
        said. It was a good omen for
        to-morrow's attempt to send Lt.-Col.
        John Glenn three times round
        the earth.

        But several intricate manœuvres
        must be made by Ranger III before
        the planned Monday landing. Included
        is a tricky firing of a mid-course
        rocket 16 hours after
        launching to direct the payload on
        a collision course with the Moon.

        Five minutes after launching the
        Atlas rocket burned out about
        150 miles up. The rocket coasted
        for about 30 seconds, then the
        Agena motor fired for a 2½-minute
        "burn," blasting the second stage
        clear from the Atlas.

        The Agena and the spacecraft
        then soared into "parking" orbit
        at 18,000 m.p.h.

        At about 70,000ft from the Moon
        and eight seconds before the spacecraft
        is due to crash-land at 6,000
        mph, the lunar capsule will be
        expelled. It is less than 12in in
        diameter and should hit the planet
        at under 150 mph.

        # U.S. CAPSULE ON WAY TO MOON

        ## Landfall on Monday: perfect launching

        ## COL. GLENN PREPARES FOR ORBIT TO-DAY

        From ALEX FAULKNER,
        Daily Telegraph Special Correspondent

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Friday.

        THE United States to-day fired Ranger III, a space
        craft packed with instruments, to the Moon.
        Its aim is to send back close-range television pictures
        of the Moon and transmit radio signals when it lands.

        The gold and silver craft was shot into space at
        8.30 p.m. (GMT) from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and
        was expected to reach a speed of 24,500 m.p.h. It
        was powered by two rockets, an Atlas and an Agena,
        both of which fired as planned.

        After a perfect launching, Ranger III appeared
        to be on its way to the Moon. The Johannesburg
        and Woomera tracking stations picked up its signals
        and it was announced that "the vehicle is leaving
        the Earth fairly close to the right trajectory."

        If all goes well the spacecraft will land on the Moon at
        3 p.m. on Monday, after a 236,924-mile trip through space.
        Britain's Jodrell Bank radio telescope was due to track its
        journey to help with scientific
        data when it comes above the
        British horizon about 2.30 a.m.
        to-morrow.

        Officials announced 10 minutes
        after launching that the Agena-B
        second-stage rocket had ignited
        successfully the first time and
        had entered its orbital coasting
        phase.

        # Seven phases of the Moon rocket

        By John Maddox, our Science
        Correspondent

        The sequence of events planned
        to follow the launching of the most
        complicated rocket yet launched
        from either the United States or the
        Soviet Union is in itself a demonstration
        of how much ingenuity and
        development has gone into the preparation
        of this device in the last
        seven months, when it was rst
        launched.

        1. Thirty minutes after launching a
        computer was intended to arrange that
        the panels carrying the batteries
        intended to turn the energy of the sun
        into electricity should spring out
        from their folded positions and begin
        to produce power for the rocket. At
        the same time radio aeriels were
        intended to spring out of the rear.

        2. Three minutes later the rocket was
        planned to begin "looking" for the
        sun with the help of six radiation
        detectors mounted on it. The process
        of finding the sun and slowing down
        the spinning of the rocket by means
        of gyroscopes and jets of gas was
        expected to take something like 29
        minutes.

        3. Three and a half hours after launching
        the rocket was planned to begin
        looking for the earth by means of a
        device consisting of a combination of
        a sensitive radio aeriel and a device
        for picking up optical radiation. From
        this point on its journey the rocket
        would remain fixed in its direction in
        space with regard to the sun and the
        earth.

        4. Four hours after launching it was
        planned that one of the instruments
        carried on the rocket---one for detecting
        X-rays---should spring out on a
        telescopic arm 72 inches long and
        begin to take measurements. Later on
        in this hight the arm is intended to
        be lengthened.

        5. Twelve and a half hours after launching
        the rocket will, for the second
        time, be within radio contact of the
        observatory at Goldstone, Arizona, and
        at this point a check was planned of
        the accuracy with which the rocket
        had lined itself up with respect to
        the sun and the earth. Corrections to
        this procedure could if necessary be
        sent to the rocket from the earth.

        6. Sixteen hours after launching, the
        rocket will at the limit of the distance
        over which its less sensitive radio
        aerial works well, and this point has
        been chosen for carrying out any
        corrections to the course of the rocket
        which may be shown to be necessary
        by observation from the ground.

        7. For the next two days---that is until
        roughly 10 o'clock on Monday morning---the
        rocket will continue passively on
        its course while stations on the ground
        will mak eexact calculations of when
        it should arrive at the moon and
        where. These will be used to work
        out when it will be necessary to turn
        on the scientific instruments intended
        to gather information about the moon.

        # MOON HERE I COME

        BIGHEAD, the American
        moon probe, is streaking
        towards its target
        today.

        By 2.30 p.m. GMT on Monday
        it is expected to be sending back
        pictures of the surface of our
        nearest neighbour in space.

        The gold and silver plated space
        craft that holds Bighead was launched
        on course from Cape Canaveral,
        Florida, alst night.

        An 82ft. Atlas rocket began
        the shot, with an Agena
        B booster to give it the 24,000
        m.p.h. thrust to get it clear
        of the earth.

        The success was a curtain
        raiser for Lt.-Col. John Glenn's
        historic round-the-world
        flight today.

        When the space craft
        launched last night is 2,000
        miles from the moon the
        TV camera will begin taking
        100 pictures, which will
        end when the craft is 15
        miles up.

        A 25in. balsa wood ball
        filled with instruments---nicknamed
        Bighead by the
        Sketch---will then separate.

        As the space craft
        crashes to destruction into
        the moon, Bighead will be
        slowed by rockets to land
        at 150 m.p.h. It will then
        drain off its oil and start
        sending signals about the
        moon.

        The balsa wood surround
        will take the shock of the
        landing.

        The Australian tracking
        station at Woomera picked
        up signals.

        Dr. James Pickering,
        director of the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory at the University
        of California, said
        the shot "looks very nice."

        ## COL. GLENN READY

        ## Space "Count-down"

        While Ranger III was making its
        complex trip through space, the
        count-down for Lt.-Col. Glenn's
        orbital flight went ahead. The
        launching is due between 12.30
        p.m. GMT and 5.30 p.m. GMT.

        Commands to Ranger III were
        issued from the Goldstone tracking
        station in California's Mojave
        Desert. They were designed to put
        it on the right course for the Moon.

        So close is this spacecraft to being
        an almost-human robot that
        one official said to-day: "They're
        not really commands, they're just
        requests."

        The lunar capsule, which will be
        expelled before the spacecraft hits
        the Moon, contains a seisometer.
        From this, data on lunar earthquakes,
        if any, and meteoritic impacts
        will be broadcast back to
        Earth.

        Packed in a cushioning cradle
        of balsa wood and floated in oil,
        the capsule will take about 20
        minutes to get ready for action. It
        has to assume the correct position
        and point its antenna at Earth.

        ## SPHERE'S CONTROL

        ## Temperature Data

        Data on temperatures during the
        14-day lunar day and the 14-day
        lunar night will also be transmitted.
        Ingenious arrangements have been
        made to control the temperature
        inside the sphere.

        It has to be kept within the
        operating limits of its electronics
        gear and batteries so that it will
        neither freeze nor melt. It will face
        temperatures between 260 degrees
        Fahrenheit and minus 230 degrees.

        The transmission of television
        pictures is timed to start 40
        minutes before impact, at a distance
        of 2,500 miles. It is expected
        to end about 15 miles above the
        moon and eight seconds before
        impact.

        More than 100 complete pictures
        are hoped for. The Ranger's
        camera is expected to send back
        pictures in which objects 12ft in
        diameter can be resolved.

        WHEN the Americans set
        about the task of firing
        the spacecraft Ranger III
        from Cape Canaveral last
        night, they were taking the
        first step in one of the most
        exciting and complicated
        scientific experiments undertaken
        by man.

        Ranger III aims to land scientific
        instruments on the Moon and for
        the first time transmit back to
        Earth the results of the television
        camera and of the seisometer.
        These will record "the heartbeat
        of the Moon."

        The National Aeronautical and
        Space Administration has planned
        Ranger III for many months.
        Ranger I and Ranger II were
        launched unsuccessfully on August
        23 and November 18 last year.

        If Ranger III's instruments go
        into action it will be the first time
        that man has received a direct
        message from the surface of the
        Moon.

        ## "PARKING" ORBIT

        ## Coasting 100 Miles High

        "Finding" the Moon by an unmanned
        spacecraft involves a series
        of difficult and complicated operations.
        The booster rockets taking
        the spacecraft through the Earth's
        atmosphere must come to a stop
        while coasting in a 100-mile-high
        "parking orbit."

        Then Ranger III must point
        accurately to the position where
        the Moon will be in 66 hours time,
        the time of flight from Earth to the
        Moon. It was this manoeuvre
        which failed in Ranger I and
        Ranger II.

        Ranger III contains radar equipment
        and a spectrometer to
        measure the radio-activity, if any,
        of the moon. It has small rocket
        engines to correct its course halfway
        between the Earth and the
        Moon, and antennae to receive instructions
        from Earth to guide it.

        It also has two large panels to
        receive light from the Sun. In
        these the light is changed into electricity
        which charges up the batteries
        of Ranger III and thus provides
        power for its scientific
        instruments.

        Cape Canaveral, January 26

        The United States Ranger III spacecraft, powered by a huge Atlas-Agena
        rocket, was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral this
        evening, bound for the moon, which, it is hoped, it will reach in
        66 hours and whence it will send back television pictures to the earth.
        The launching appeared to be perfect.

        At the same time the country is keyed up awaiting the launching
        of Lieutenant-Colonel John Glenn's first American orbital flight round
        the earth tomorrow. The final preparations for this are going ahead
        smoothly, and the weather is co-operating with calm seas in the
        area down-range where the Mercury capsule will have to be recovered.

        This evening the moon rocket, standing 88ft. high with its 15ft.
        spacecraft, soared like a silver streak directly into the cloudless sky,
        its engines thundering and the
        almost white light of the flames
        becoming a pinpoint in the sky. It
        disappeared from view in three
        minutes, leaving only a thin vapour
        trail.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration announced
        that the Atlas booster had burned
        out on time five minutes after
        launching at an altitude of about
        150 miles. The rocket and its capsule
        was then coasting for about
        half a minute before explosive
        charges released the Agena second-stage
        rocket. There were signs that
        this had been achieved.

        A NASA official announced that the
        Australian tracking station at Woomera
        had picked up Ranger signals and "the
        vehicle is leaving the earth fairly close
        to the right trajectory... . It appears
        we have a normal flight."

        ## 18,000 mph

        Soon afterwards it was stated that
        the Agena, which had been carried up
        to 150 miles by the Atlas, had completed
        its first two-and-a-half-minute
        "burn" to reach an orbital speed of
        18,000 miles an hour. The Atlas had
        separated satisfactorily.

        If this complex operation succeeds
        the world will get, besides close-up
        television pictures of the moon, more
        accurate readings on temperature variations
        between the 14-day lunar days and
        nights, and new data which could end
        an ancient controversy over the moon's
        composition. They will also learn
        something of what goes on deep inside
        it.

        Four tracking stations round the
        world---two near Johannesburg, one at
        Woomera, South Australia, and the
        other at Goldstone, California---are to
        track the rocket and Ranger on their
        historic journey, to receive data and to
        send the spacecraft signals which
        scientists hope will cause it to change
        course in mid-flight far out in space
        and head for the moon.

        After the rockets have separated
        from the spacecraft the Ranger will
        begin a series of novel and complex
        feats which should end early on
        Monday when, it is intended, it will
        crash into the moon at 6,000 m.p.h.
        after ejecting a specially protected
        seismometer which should land at the
        more gentle speed of 150 m.p.h. This
        seismometer is designed to send back
        reports on moonquakes or meteorite
        impacts for 30 days.

        ## Digital computer

        A small digital computer has been
        stored with carefully timed commands
        in the core of Ranger's space navigation
        system. The commands it gives,
        which will be supervised and if necessary
        overridden back on earth, will
        first steer Ranger through a 180-degree
        turn away from the burned-out Agena.
        Then Ranger is to unfold solar power
        cell paddles and a directional antenna
        and perform a three-axis manoeuvre to
        lock the solar paddles on the sun and
        the antenna on earth while speeding
        through space.

        When it is within 5,000 miles of the
        moon the spacecraft must reverse
        itself so the television camera is
        pointed at the moon. At 70,000 feet
        from the lunar body the seismometer
        capsule attached to a retro-rocket is
        separated. The retro-rocket fires and
        is powerful enough to slow the seismometer
        package from 6,000 m.p.h. to a
        standstill by the time it is 1,100 feet
        from the moon.---Reuter

        # U.S. MOON SHOT

        From ALEX FAULKNER
        (Continued from P1, Col [...])

        Officials in charge of the project
        were asked to-day whether they
        had picked an impact area on the
        Moon. One said: "We'll be delighted
        to hit it at all!"

        If all goes well---and it would be
        astonishing if it did---the landing
        will be made on the lighted side
        near the lunar equator. It will be
        known about one day after launching
        whether the spacecraft is likely
        make a landing.

        There is no United States flag
        or other emblem on Ranger III.
        It has been painstakingly sterilised
        by heat, radiation and fumigation.

        ## CLOSE-UP PICTURES
        ## Objects 15ft Long

        An hour before impact a radio
        command will point the axis of the
        television camera at the Moon. At
        40 minutes before impact, when
        Ranger III should be about 2,500
        miles above the lunar surface, the
        television camera will start taking
        a series of 100 pictures, the first
        close-up view of the Moon's
        surface.

        The first pictures should include
        an area of about 25 miles square
        while the last should cover an area
        of only 1,000ft square and might
        show objects only 12ft long.

        Eight seconds before the impact,
        when Ranger III is 70,000ft from
        the Moon, the landing capsule will
        be separated from the spacecraft.

        The television camera and the
        spectrometer which measure the
        radio-activity will be destroyed on
        landing on the Moon. The capsule
        containing the other instruments
        should descend relatively slowly on
        to the Moon.

        The impact speed will be about
        150 m.p.h. The instruments are
        packed in a sphere surrounded by
        heavy oil with the same density as
        the sphere itself. The outer sphere
        is encased in a balsa wood container,
        surrounded by a glass fibre
        shell.

        # MOON-SHOT

        DOCUMENTARY SKETCH BY CHARLES MACHARDY

        ## RANGER 3

        RANGER III soared 150 miles up and went into
        orbit. Then booster rockets sent the spacecraft
        hurtling on its 66-hour journey to the moon.

        America's rocket Ranger III speeds on its way
        to take close-up photographs of the moon --- a
        journey of about 60 hours (this page). It seemed
        to be a perfect launching and a good omen for
        spaceman John Glenn, who waits to be fired into
        orbit today. Last night he gave a message to the
        world

        # SPACEMAN IS ALL SET

        From RONALD BEDFORD
        Cape Canaveral, Florida, Sunday

        THE outlook is bright
        for America's bid to
        send a Spaceman three
        times round the world
        on Wednesday.

        After gloomy, overcast
        skies, the sun shone brilliantly
        here today. And the
        weathermen say the forecast
        is good.

        The astronaut chosen for
        the three-orbit trip, Marine
        Colonel John Glenn, 40, is
        in perfect shape, physically
        and mentally.

        Today he drove to
        church, then had a steak
        and salad lunch with his
        stand-in Commander
        Scott Carpenter, 37.

        ## Nurses

        America's first man in
        Space, Commander Alan
        Shepard, 39, was also at the
        lunch. He is technical
        adviser to the Space-shot
        team.

        Two pretty nurses will
        keep a round-the-clock
        watch on Glenn's health
        until the early-morning
        blast-off from Pad 14.

        John Herschel Glenn, fifth and---at 40---oldest
        of earth's space riders, is rarin' to go. After
        a pre-dawn breakfast of steak and eggs he
        donned his silvery space suit and walked out to
        the Atlas rocket which is due to blast him into a
        triple orbit of the earth this afternoon.

        A lift whisked the powerfully built red-haired
        astronaut up the gigantic gantry to his 4200-lb. capsule
        and a moment later he was sealed inside.

        Open to him now as he waits in his own little world
        of air is the chance to clinch a triumph for his countrymen
        as well as taste the thrills of outer space.

        As thousands of Americans began praying in
        hundreds of churches throughout the U.S. and in the
        waiting rescue ships an official reported: "Everything
        is go."

        Technicians swarmed over
        Pad 14 checking and rechecking
        every inch of the
        space craft and the capsule
        christened Friendship Seven.

        Loud-speakers tersely bark
        out the landmarks in this
        all-embracing check on
        rocket, spacecraft and escape
        tower.

        ## 15,000 men wait

        After five postponements
        there is a real feeling of go here
        today. We are thinking
        deliberately of the successes
        with Atlas rather than the
        failures.

        Far out across the ocean a
        £25 million chain of tracking
        stations and a recovery force
        made up of 15,000 men and 26
        ships is reporting in.

        This is the biggest and most
        costly scientific experiment ever
        set up by man---draining away
        £500,000 every day it is kept
        waiting.

        Its justification: to save the
        life of one man. That man at
        this moment, we are told, is not
        unduly anxious.

        Near him all the time is his
        "back up" astronaut Scott
        Carpenter, 36, whose feelings as
        he waits in the wings must be
        very mixed.

        Equally content to remain out
        of the Iimelight are 12 British
        rocket engineers who have
        helped in the design of the
        Friendship Seven.

        ## The facts

        On the wooden grandstand
        around me some 500 journalists,
        cameramen and newsreel commentators
        are scrambling the
        facts out to a world which Glenn
        should soon have at his feet.

        A liberal supply of facts is
        pouring from the man who has
        always been go-between for the
        seven Mercury astronauts and
        the public---Colonel "Shorty"
        Powers. A wag has quipped:
        "How's superman doin', Shorty?"

        Colonel Powers has been at
        pains to stress the vital role
        which Glenn will play in deciding
        how the Friendship Seven
        capsule is to be manoeuvred
        once it gets into space, and how
        long it should be left in orbit. It
        may go round twice or thrice.
        Glenn has the say.

        One circle will plunge it back
        into the sea 500 miles east of
        Bermuda; the second to the
        south; and the third will return
        him south-east of here.

        Lunch should be "served"
        through plastic squeeze tubes at
        the end of orbit one. The
        splendid performance of the
        Atlas booster has given morale
        a much-needed pep-shot and
        huge parties are planned all
        over the Cape tonight.

        The toast of the evening is
        supposed to miss the lot and
        rest in a hospital---calming down
        and delivering his precious
        medical data and verbal reports.

        ## Sleep? Impossible

        As for Glenn's wife, Anna,
        she is reported to be sensibly
        asleep in Virginia. I wonder.
        Sleep for most of us has been
        impossible here because of the
        huge publicity operation that
        had to be mounted, with busloads
        of reporters disgorging on
        to the rattler-infested and
        palmetto-studded Cape.

        The American taxpayer has
        been bled of £180 million for the
        project which is now reaching
        its climax---and officials are
        determined they shall have a
        complimentary ticket for today's
        show, no matter where they are.
        The nation is being hooked up by
        TV. Every beautiful or nasty
        detail is vividly exposed.

        ## Columbus

        The man who will decree "Go"
        for the tough, super-fit but balding
        Marine, has the very apposite
        name of Christopher Columbus
        Kraft.

        Mr. Kraft is the flight controller
        at the hub of things, a
        huge concrete blockhouse where
        there are now scenes of tension
        and brouhaha as all the variable
        factors in project Mercury---weather,
        tracking network,
        rocket, astronaut and recovery
        force---are "blended" to give a
        state of countdown.

        Right now it looks good, and
        for the man who complained
        jokingly of being "just the
        bridesmaid" when Alan Shepard
        and Virgil Grissom rode their
        rockets into space it is nearly
        time to be the bride.

        * The U.S. Ranger moon shot---sent
        up yesterday and 20,000--30,000
        miles off course---was
        tracked by Jodrell Bank this
        morning.

        From JOYCE EGGINTON, Cape Canaveral, Friday

        A GIANT Atlas-Agena rocket soared
        into a cloudless sky above here
        tonight. Destination: Moon.

        The news that the spaceshot was on schedule
        and on course brought cheer to America on the
        eve of astronaut John Glenn's attempt to orbit
        the earth.

        The Atlas is carrying a gold-and-silver-plated
        Robot Ranger III spacecraft with which it is hoped
        to take TV close-up photographs of the moon and
        then crash-land instruments there.

        At 8.30 p.m. London
        time the rocket was fired
        on its 238,000-mile journey,
        scheduled to last 66
        hours.

        Latest reports said Ranger
        III "appeared to be making
        apparently perfect fight,"
        and had been contacted by
        tracking stations in South
        Africa and Australia.

        As the space-shot rose,
        spewing flame in its wake,
        its vapour trail drifted in the
        wind and formed a question
        mark high above the launching
        pad.

        The sign was appropriate.
        America must wait until sometime
        on Monday before knowing
        whether the spaceshot has
        reached its target.

        The launching seemed perfect.
        The first-stage rocket took the
        space-shot 150 miles up in two-and-a-half
        minutes.

        The second stage fired on
        schedule. This left the spaceshot
        orbiting at 18,000 m.p.h. for
        seven minutes.

        Then the rockets opened up
        again and, using the second
        stage rocket as a launching
        platform, hurled Ranger III on
        its planned trajectory towards
        the Moon.

        ## THE RISK

        Ranger's TV camera is due
        to take more than 100 pictures,
        beginning 2,000 miles from the
        moon's surface and ending when
        the spacecraft was only 15 miles
        off it.

        From then on the spacecraft
        will race towards the Moon
        for a 6,000 m.p.h. crash-landing

        Just before impact a seismometer---to
        measure moonquakes
        and meteor hits---will be
        ejected and slowed by retrorocket
        so that it can land at
        150 m.p.h.

        Back on the launching site
        waited Astronaut Glenn, ready
        for the space-flight scheduled
        for 12.30 p.m London time tomorrow.

        As the count-down continued
        he sent a message to the world---a
        message of courage, concern
        and confidence.

        ## THE BLAST OFF

        Destination: Moon

        Addressed briefly to the 600
        reporters from 16 nations who
        will be covering his space flight,
        he asked us to remember that
        he is well aware of the risks he
        is taking.

        But he also warned us to
        realise that "pioneers have
        faced these risks throughout the
        ages and that did not stop exploration."

        Glenn, still busy checking his
        flight plans, sent his message
        through Lientenant-Colonel
        John Powers, spokesman for
        Project Mercury.

        "He was very concerned that
        you understand the tremendous
        complexity of his task," Colonel
        Powers said.

        "He is aware we have done
        everything possible to reduce
        risks in the mission. But there
        is still a risk and let us never
        forget it.

        "If anything happens to him
        he wants people to understand
        that he is well aware of what
        he is undertaking."

        Asked if Glenn was saying
        that the space programme
        should continue even if he
        were killed, Colonel Power
        replied: "That's about it."

        In case of a major disaster,
        Colonel Powers stated firmly
        that Glenn has NOT been supplied
        with a cyanide pill.

        Colonel Powers said every
        effort will be made for Glenn's
        flight to take place tomorrow,
        even if his take-off time has
        to be delayed up to four hours.

        If there is such a delay, his
        flight will be reduced from
        three orbits to two or one, to
        allow for the necessary three
        hours of daylight in the Atlantic
        recovery area.

        Colonel Powers said: "The
        directors of the mission will be
        satisfied with one orbit, pleased
        with two and mighty happy with
        three."

        CANAVERAL FLASH: Countdown continuing
        on schedule. "Everything is go," said a National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman.

        From PETER FAIRLEY: Cape Canaveral, Saturday

        John Herschel Glenn, fifth and---at 40---oldest
        of earth's space riders, is rarin' to go. He
        has shaved, showered and eaten solid steak and
        eggs. Open to him now---the chance to clinch
        a triumph for his countrymen as well as taste
        the thrills of outer space.

        The scene is wonderous
        with the moon hanging
        tantalisingly in front of
        the tiny Ranger spacecraft
        sent up yesterday and flood
        lights shimmering on the
        stainless steel flanks of the
        second Atlas rocket waiting
        to go.

        But Ranger is hurtling too
        fast---coverning nine miles a
        second. So the old green
        cheese will keep its secrets a
        little longer.

        Scientists are claiming the
        shot an 80 per cent success.

        Down on pad 14 here a
        huge gantry is hunched over
        the bell-shaped Mercury
        space craft, christened
        Friendship Seven by the test
        pllot who will shotly climb
        inside.

        ## Checks all the way

        Technicians are checking every
        inch of it for faults. And in
        hangars nearby the 12-stone
        astronaut is being checked by
        doctors.

        John Glenn today must be the
        most poked at, prodded and
        psycho-analysed human guinea
        pig of all time.

        The count down is under way.
        Loud-speakers tersely bark out
        the landmarks in this all-embracing
        eight-hour check on
        rocket, spacecraft and escape
        tower.

        ## 15,000 men wait

        After five postponements
        there is a real feeling of go here
        today. We are thinking
        deliberately of the successes

        # Spotlight on Colonel Glenn

        ## Scientists' tender solicitude

        From ALISTAIR COOKE

        New York, January 26

        Castro, the Congolese, the
        Senate's military witnesses, the
        embattled Algerians, and all other
        such spear-carriers slunk off into the
        wings today and left the centre-stage
        spotlight on the hero for
        tonight: the bronzed out dazed
        guinea pig known as Lieutenant
        Colonel John H. Glenn.

        Like the rest of us, he is composed
        almost entirely of the compounds of
        carbon with a little water added. But
        he is prized like no champion Black
        Angus, tuned like no Stradivarius,
        gaped at, preserved, and photographed
        more lovingly than the Parthenon. For
        three weeks at least no human in the
        history of medicine has been so
        weighed and X-rayed and pumped and
        filtered and tapped.

        There is a file at Cape Canaveral
        which bears the reports and signatures
        of twenty-odd specialists who know,
        better than they know their own
        children, the Colonel's heartbeat, pulse,
        respiration, and sedimentation rates,
        his circulatory eccentricities, the location
        and density of his calcium
        deposits, the chemical composition of
        his transverse colon at any hour of
        the day and night, and the colour of
        his tympanic membranes.

        He is coddled as delicately as any
        filterable virus, and somewhere in a
        sound-proof bunk deep in Cape
        Canaveral's jungle of towers and radar
        sources and launching pads he is put
        to rest with the tenderness of a mother
        hiding her first-born from Herod.

        ## The chosen time

        But if he has been the main object
        in life to a protective convoy of
        doctors, psychiatrists, engineers, physicists,
        Marine officers, Secret Service
        men, and stand-by astronauts, his
        earthbound care and comfort are
        nothing to the solicitude that sets in
        at the chosen time, between 7 30 and
        12 30 in the morning, when his black
        Mercury capsule receives the thrust
        of the Atlas rocket and he is launched
        up and away towards Bermuda.

        At that moment, 510 technicians at
        16 lonely stations around the earth
        and on two ships will tense to the
        alert before dials, gauges, and radar
        screens and wait for their privileged
        spell of six minutes, during which they
        must watch him, and maybe save him,
        on his flight from horizon to horizon.
        It was the Muchea station, in South-west
        Australia, that first spotted and
        reported back to Canaveral the overheating
        of the capsule that bore Enos,
        our beloved chimpanzee.

        Unlike the so-called "basic" stations,
        as at Kano (Nigeria) and Zanzibar,
        which can only talk to the astronaut
        and pass on electronic information,
        Muchea is one of the "command"
        stations of the Mercury range; that
        is to say, it can give orders to the
        capsule and fire the retro-rockets that
        brake its speed and return it to the
        earth.

        Meanwhile another 15,000 men, on
        a hundred ships, and uncounted land-based
        forces of the Army and Coastguard
        will also take their cue from
        the Canaveral countdown, assume their
        posts as a rescue force, and wait for
        the alarm signal: "No-Go." This could
        come as early as two and a half minutes
        after the firing, when the capsule is
        ready to be launched into orbit. At
        that point it will be under the surveillance
        of the first of the Mercury
        tracking stations, at Bermuda.

        ## If things go wrong

        The Bermuda men must decide
        within 30 seconds whether the flight
        path is angled right, whether the
        capsule is at the correct 40-mile
        altitude, and whether its speed is at
        the exact 17,500 miles an hour
        necessary to pull away from the force
        of gravity and soar into orbit. If it
        was going too slow, it would already
        be dropping to earth; if too fast it
        would be headed into space beyond
        the control of the astronaut or his
        protection force.

        If anything was wrong, then or
        through the whole one hour and
        36 minutes of each of the three
        planned orbits, there are 17 other
        tracking stations along the Mercury
        range capable of receiving more than
        60 types of information from a single
        radio impulse of the capsule, of sending
        them to be unscrambled at the Goddard
        Space Flight Centre in Maryland,
        which would pass them on to a master
        computer at Canaveral and thus
        provoke the order to fire the retrorocket
        in the capsule's nose and bring
        the man down.

        If Glenn is launched before 9 a.m.
        he will mean to make three orbits, if
        after 10 30 only two, if after 12 only
        one. The rule is to try to allow six
        hours of daylight on land or sea for
        his search and rescue. If all goes
        according to plan on a single orbit he
        will be picked up 500 miles east of
        Bermuda; after two orbits 500 miles
        south of Bermuda; after three orbits
        800 miles south-east of Canaveral deep
        in the Caribbean.

        ## The trajectory

        The long-stop crew of 15,510 men,
        100 ships, to say nothing of the 63 men
        manning 36 aeroplanes of the Air
        Force's Rescue Service, are trained to
        prepare for the worst at any point
        along the trajectory that begins in
        Florida, loops the Atlantic, streaks
        across Africa and the Indian Ocean,
        passes over Australia and the long
        Pacific, whirls over California, New
        Mexico, Texas, and on again to Florida.

        If he makes it, his protectors will
        fall away like winter flies. He will,
        after 48 hours' decompression, be
        asked what he would like to eat. He
        may choose something as unclinical
        as a hamburger or a milk shake. He
        will be returned from the laboratory
        and restored, with a laurel wreath, to
        the human race.

        From RONALD BEDFORD, Cape Canaveral, Tuesday

        AMERICAN astronaut John Glenn's three-times-round-the-world
        Space trip has been postponed
        again---this time because of "technical difficulties."

        Glenn, 40, was due to be fired from the launching pad here on
        Thursday in a shot that would make him the first American to
        orbit the earth.

        But this afternoon, Colonel John Powers, chief
        spokesman for the project, said that the attempt---first
        fixed for last
        Saturday and put off
        because of bad weather---will
        not now be made
        earller than February 13.

        ## Halted

        It was stated that technical
        difficulties in the
        "launch vehicle"---a 93ft.-long
        Atlas rocket---had
        stopped plans for the flight.

        Spaceman Glenn, who
        had spent five hours in his
        capsule, the size of a telephone
        kiosk, when Saturday's
        shot was called off,
        said, when told of the new
        delay:

        "I am disappointed. But
        this is a complicated business."

        He added: "I don't
        think we should fly until
        all elements of the mission
        are ready.

        "When we have completed
        all our tests satisfactorily,
        then we'll go."

        ## Setbacks

        The postponement is a
        bitter blow---the latest and
        most severe in a series of
        setbacks.

        America's much-vaunted
        Space Week, which ends
        tomorrow, has turned out
        to be one of flops and
        failures.

        No wonder there are
        hundreds of gloomy faces
        here tonight.

        # GLENN IS ALL READY, BUT..

        From RONALD BEDFORD,
        Cape Canaveral, Tuesday

        THE count-down of the
        huge Atlas rocket that
        is due to blast US Spaceman
        John Glenn into orbit
        tomorrow began at the
        launching base here today.

        But, because of the
        weather, Space officials
        rate the chances of Glenn's
        taking off as only 50-50.

        Preparations are going
        ahead, and engineers
        checked every detail of the
        100-ton Atlas and the two-ton
        Spaceship Friendship
        Seven perched on top.

        But out in the Atlantic,
        in the area where 40-year-old
        Colonel Glenn will
        come down, stormy seas
        are running. And the forecast
        for tomorrow is that
        it will still be rough.

        ANOTHER Atlas was
        fired on a 7,000-mile test
        flight today. Officials said
        the test was successful.

        # SPACE GAMBLE FAILS AGAIN

        From RONALD BEDFORD
        Cape Canaveral, Wednesday

        THE blunt truth is
        now being admitted
        here that the
        plan to shoot astronaut
        John Glenn into
        orbit was a gamble.

        A £150,000,000 gamble on
        the weather. And a
        gamble that faces
        failure.

        A new set-back came at
        2 a.m. today when Colonel
        Glenn, 40, was
        awakened here and told
        the attempt was off.

        High waves in the ocean
        areas where the Space
        capsule might have
        come down caused experts
        to halt the final
        count down.

        It was the eighth postponement
        for Glenn---and
        seven were caused
        by the weather, which is
        notoriously fickle at this
        time of year.

        Why was the gamble
        taken? Mainly to narrow
        at the earliest
        moment the time gap
        between the successful
        orbiting of the Soviet
        cosmonauts and the
        first American.

        Now the situation is
        gloomy. If bad weather
        continues, a decision
        needs to be taken to recall
        the waiting ships.

        There are sixty planes,
        twenty-four ships and
        15,000 men in the sea-recovery
        zones.

        * Was the gamble to
        get a man up quickly
        really worth while?
        Some people here are
        wondering. . . .

        # Weather still holds the Space aces

        From RONALD BEDFORD
        Cape Canaveral, Monday

        AGAIN America is
        racked with Space
        fever as TV and radio
        networks warm up the
        nation for Valentine's
        Day triple-orbit by
        Spaceman John Glenn.

        Again the big stumbling
        block is the
        weather.

        Right now it is good
        here. But in the area
        where Glenn will plop
        into the sea at the end
        of his mission strong
        winds are whipping up
        10ft.-high waves.

        But, despite the
        weather, it was announced
        tonight that the
        count-down will begin
        tomorrow.

        The bell-shaped, two-ton
        Spacecraft can
        land safely only when
        waves are not more
        than four feet high.

        At sea in three impact
        zones---one for each of
        three orbits---a task
        force of 24 ships, 60 aircraft
        and 15,000 men Is
        in position.

        They are waiting for
        a blob in the sky that
        means Glenn is on his
        way down.

        A round-the-world
        network of eighteen
        tracking stations---including
        two radar ships---are
        also standing by
        to watch over Glenn.

        They span three continents
        and three
        oceans.

        ## Robots

        Near Washington,
        about a thousand miles
        north of Cape Canaveral,
        fifty scientists and
        some of the world's
        fastest robot brains will
        predict where Glenn
        and the spaceship
        should be every second
        of his one and three-quarter
        hour trip.
        Robots have the job of
        working out the precise
        moment to fire braking
        rockets aboard the
        Spaceship to bring
        Glenn home.

        Glenn's orbital path
        has been carefully
        planned to avoid Communist-held
        territory.

        * A sign outside a
        hotel here says:
        "The hopes and prayers
        of the free world are
        with Colonel John
        Glenn."

        # GLENN ALL SET FOR TODAY

        AMERICAN astronaut
        John Glenn hopes to
        make his triple orbit of the
        globe today.

        This will be his eleventh
        date for the big blast-off
        and last night on-the-spot
        observers at Cape Canaveral,
        the US rocket base,
        described the chances as
        "definitely good."

        It is estimated that
        Glenn's fantastic journey
        will take nearly five hours.

        ## Spaceman John 'Feels Great'

        # GOING GOING GLENN

        From JOHN GOLD

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Tuesday.

        IT'S all set to go. Spaceman John Glenn is in his
        silver space-craft and the clock is ticking off the
        final minutes to the start of his 17,500 m.p.h. rocket
        ride three times around the earth.

        Weather in the three Atlantic recovery zones is
        reported to be good. But cloud hangs over the flood-lit
        launch area here at Cape
        Canaveral.

        It was reported to be thickening,
        but the countdown is going
        on.

        Project Mercury men are
        confident, however, that the
        hot Florida sun will burn
        through in time for the blast
        off.

        Only a key-hole in the sky
        is needed through which to
        rocket Glenn into orbit. Mercury
        control was hopeful:
        "Everything is go, it looks
        good."

        Glenn appeared calm and
        assured as he emerged from
        Hangar S after spending
        several hours resting in readiness
        for the flight.

        He did not speak, but Lt. Col.
        John Powers, the astronaut's
        spokesman, said: "John feels
        great."

        ## A SMILE

        ## Then The Drive

        If his nerves have suffered
        from the ten postponements
        of his orbit ride he gave no
        sign of it.

        The 40-year-old astronaut
        was smiling behind the visor
        of his silver space suit as he
        climbed into the white-painted
        van which took him to the
        launch zone.

        But space officials clearly
        want to spare him a repeat
        performance of the experience
        just 25 days ago when he spent
        more than four vain hours
        cramped in the Mercury capsule
        waiting for the launching
        that never came.

        As the van arrived at the foot
        of the gleaming 93-ft. rocket the
        spacemen clustered at the site
        were studying reports on the
        thick cloud.

        It was the same heavy grey
        blanket which had forced the
        January postponement. So to
        save Glenn at least some time
        in the top-shaped space craft
        a 30-minute weather hold was
        announced.

        ## HE TALKS

        ## With Doctors

        The astronaut spent the time
        waiting in the comfortable
        transit van talking with doctors
        and officials.

        Then promtly at 6.03 (11.03
        London time) he stepped on to
        the lift which carried him up
        the gantry to the space capsule.

        If all goes well and the skies
        clear the Atlas rocket will hurl
        Glen and his capsule into orbit
        about 100 miles over Bermuda.

        It will speed through the
        weightless, emptiness of space
        across Africa, the Indian Ocean,
        Australia, the Pacific, Mexico
        and the southern United
        States.

        ## SCIENTISTS

        ## Are Watching

        Glenn will go back and forth
        across the equator from the
        winter of the northern hemisphere
        into the summer of the
        southern hemisphere and
        across the international dateline
        from the daytime of
        Tuesday into the night-time
        of Wednesday and back into
        Tuesday again.

        Throughout most of his
        long flight he will be in a
        state of weightlessness.

        Scientists are anxiously
        watching to see what effect
        this has on him.

        When the Soviet cosmonaut
        Titov made his 17-orbit flight
        last August he suffered long
        bouts of air sickness.

        If Glenn goes the full three
        orbits it will take four and
        three quarter hours. A two-orbit
        mission would be three
        and a quarter hours and a
        single orbit one and three
        quarter hours.

        # Transcript

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)---U.S.
        space agency officials released the
        following transcript of conversations
        with John H. Glenn Jr. during
        his orbital flight. Some purely
        technical conversations have been
        eliminated.

        Glenn: Five-four-three-two-one-zero,
        liftoff. The clock is operating.
        We are under way. Roger. Read
        you loud and clear. Roger.

        Mercury Control: We are programing
        . . . Okay.

        Glenn: It is a little bumpy along
        about here. Roger.

        MC: Flight path is good.

        Glenn: Checks okay. Minus 7, on
        your mark.

        MC: Roger. Reading you clear,
        John.

        Glenn: Coming into high gear a
        little bit. A little contrail went by
        the window or something. Roger.
        102 . . . 101 . . . Oxygen 78 . . .
        101 . . . Still okay. We are . . . out
        some now, getting out of the vibration
        area.

        MC: Flight path very good.

        Glenn: Pitch four three. Coming
        out real fine. Flight very smooth
        now.

        MC: Roger. Flight path is good.

        Glenn: Cabin pressure is holding
        at six one. Okay. Have had some
        oscillations, but they seem to be
        damped.

        Glenn: The clock two minutes.
        G's are building to six.

        MC: Roger. Reading you loud
        and clear. Flight path looks good,
        Pitch 25. Standby for action.

        Glenn: BECO. BECO (booster
        engines cut off). I see the tower
        go. I saw the smoke go by the
        window.

        MC: Roger. We confirm staging
        TM (telemetry).

        Glenn: Roger. Still have about
        1½ G's . . . The tower went right
        then. I have the tower in sight
        way out.

        MC: Roger, we confirm on 5.
        Tower is green.

        Glenn: 1½ G's.

        MC: Flight path looks good.

        Glenn: Retro jettisoned. Emergency
        retro jettison slips off.

        MC: Flight path looks good.

        Glenn: The steering is good.

        MC: Roger. Understand everything
        looks good.

        Glenn: G's starting to build
        again . . . Roger Bermuda, stand
        by. This Friendship 7.

        MC: Roger. Reading you loud
        and clear. Flight path looks good.

        MC: Roger. Reading you loud
        and clear. Cape is go. We are
        standing by for you.

        Glenn: Roger, Cape is go and I
        am go.

        Glenn: All systems go. Cabin
        pressure holding steady. All systems
        are go.

        MC: Roger. Twenty seconds . . .
        Flight path looks very good. Ten
        seconds, flight path still looks
        good.

        Glenn: Roger. SECO (sustainer
        engines cut off) . . . Grade fired
        okay.

        MC: Roger. Standby.

        Glenn: Roger. Zero G's and I
        feel fine. Capsule is turning
        around. Oh, that view is tremendous.

        MC: Roger.

        Glenn: Turnaround has started:
        Capsule turning around and I can
        see the booster doing turnarounds
        just a couple of hundred yards
        behind. It looks beautiful

        MC: Roger. Seven. You have a
        go of at least seven orbits.

        Glenn: Roger. Understand go for
        at least seven orbits.

        (Glenn tape recorded conversation
        with astronaut Gordon Cooper
        as the Friendship 7 spacecraft
        passed over Australia).

        Glenn: Hello, Coop, this is Friendship
        7 reading you loud and clear.

        Cooper: Roger, Friendship 7, this
        is Coop. Over.

        Glenn: We are doing real fine
        up here. Everything is going real
        well. Over.

        Cooper: Very good, John. You
        sound good.

        Glenn: All systems are still go,
        having no problems at all. Control
        system operating fine. Over.

        Cooper: Do you have any landmark
        observations?

        Glenn: Roger. I was just making
        some for the recorder, and the only
        unusual thing I have noticed was
        the rather high, what appeared
        to be a haze layer up some 7 or
        8 degrees above the horizon on
        the night side, the stars I can
        see through it as they go down
        toward the real horizon, but it is
        a very visible single band, or layer
        or . . . above the normal horizon.
        Over.

        Cooper: Roger, very interesting.

        Glenn: I had a lot of cloud cover
        coming off of Africa. It has thinned
        out considerably now, and although
        I cannot definitely see . . . there
        is a lot of moonlight here that
        reflects off of what clouds there
        are. Over.

        Cooper: Roger . . . and excellent,
        John . . . Shortly you may observe
        some lights down there. Do you
        want to take a check on that, to
        your right? Over.

        Glenn: Roger. I am all set to see
        if I can get them in sight.

        Cooper: You did have your visor
        closed?

        Glenn: I did have it opened for
        a little while. It is closed now.
        Cabin pressure is holding in good
        shape. Over . . . I feel fine. Over.

        Cooper: Good show.

        Glenn: Relay inverter is 180 degrees.
        It looks like it has done
        pretty well.

        Cooper: It looks like it is holding
        out fine.

        Glenn: That was sure a short
        day. That was about the shortest
        day I have ever run into.

        Cooper: Time passes rapidly, eh?

        Glenn: Yes, sir.

        Cooper: Okay. Do you have any
        landmark observations to make.

        Glenn: I have a . . . picking up
        some of the star patterns better
        than I was just off Africa.

        Glenn: Just to my right I can
        see a big pattern of light, apparently
        right on the coast. I can
        see . . . and a very bright light
        just to the south of it.

        Cooper: That is Perth and Rockingham
        you see there.

        Glenn: The lights show very
        well . . . On down to the south and
        inland I can see lights. There two,
        actually four, patterns in that area.
        Also coming into sight in the window
        now another one, almost down
        under me. The lights are very clear
        from up here.

        Cooper: Roger, John. Good.
        Friendship 7, we have your blood
        pressure . . .

        Glenn: This is Friendship 7. I
        have had no ill effects at all yet
        from any . . . is still excellent . . .
        no nausea or discomfort whatsoever.

        (The following is a transcript
        of recordings made during the
        pass of the spacecraft across the
        southern United States during
        the first orbit.)

        Astronaut Alan Shepard in the
        Control Center: Friendship 7, this
        is Canaveral.

        Glenn: Friendship 7 to Canaveral.
        Read you loud and clear. Over.

        Shepard: Roger, Friendship 7,
        read you loud and clear, standby
        for . . . please.

        Glenn: Roger.

        Shepard: Frienship 7, this is Cap
        Com. Would you give us the difficulty
        you were having in the yaw?
        Over.

        Glenn: Roger. This is Friendship
        7. I am going on fly by wire so
        I can control more accurately. It
        just started as I got to Guaymas
        and it appears to drift off to the
        right about one degree per second.
        It would go over to an altitude of
        about 20 degrees, then hold, and
        then when it hits at about a 20
        degree point it then goes into orientation
        mode and comes back to zero
        and it was cycling back and forth
        in that mode. I am on fly-by-wire
        now; I am controlling manually.
        Over.

        Shepard: Roger. Understand.

        Glenn: This is Friendship 7.
        What appears to have happened is
        I believe I have one pound thrust
        in left yaw, so it drifts over out
        of limits and then hits it with the
        high thrust.

        Shepard: Roger, Friendship 7,
        we concur here. Recommend you
        remain fly-by wire.

        Glenn: Roger, am remaining fly-by
        wire.

        Shepard: Roger, Friendship 7,
        we are having a little difficulty.
        Start off on your 30-minute report.

        Glenn: This is Friendship 7, controlling
        manually by fly-by wire.
        Having no trouble controlling. It
        controls very nicely.

        Shepard: Roger.

        Glenn: Fly-by wire auto gyro is
        normal . . . I have a beautiful view
        out of the window of the coast at
        the present time. Can see away
        down across Florida. Cannot quite
        see the Cape yet.

        Shepard: Roger. Still reading.

        Glenn: Cabin pressure 55 and
        holding nicely. Cabin air is 95.
        Temperature is 67 on the suit. The
        only real unusual thing so far beside
        ASCS trouble were the little
        particles, luminous particles
        around the capsule---just thousands
        of them over the Pacific. Over.

        Shepard: Roger. We have all of
        that. It looks like you are in good
        shape. Remain on fly-by wire for
        the moment.

        Excerpts of the recording of
        the spacecraft as it passed
        over the Canary Islands and the
        African coast, communicating
        with ground stations below.

        Glenn: This is Friendship 7. My
        status is excellent. I have control
        of capsule on fly-by wire at present
        time . . . Over. Have Cape
        Verde Islands in sight off my left.
        Over.

        Ground: Roger, understand.
        Friendship 7, your medical status
        is excellent.

        Glenn: Roger. Friendship 7, the
        sun is coming through the window
        and is very warm where it hits
        the suit. I get quite a bit of heat
        from it.

        Excerpts of the recordings of
        Glenn exchanges with his fellow
        astronauts, Walter Schirra at
        Point Arguello, Cal., and Shepard
        at Cape Canaveral.

        Glenn: All systems are still go.
        I had some erratic ASCS operation
        and I caged and uncaged on the
        night side and it appears to be
        working very well now, although
        I was drifting again in roll a
        moment ago. It appears to have
        corrected itself in roll, however,
        without me caging again now . . .

        Ground: Apparently it is more
        difficult to pick up drift than I
        thought it would be. Your best
        bet is to look out the window and
        try and get something moving
        away from you out the window.

        Glenn: Roger. I got you there.

        (Here is an excerpt of a conversation
        between Glenn and the
        Bermuda tracking station)

        Glenn: Friendship 7. I have the
        Cape (Canaveral) in sight. I can
        see the whole state of Florida
        just laid out like a map. Beautiful.
        I can still see clear back to the
        Mississippi Delta . . . And it looks
        very good down that way. It looks
        like we will have no problem on
        recovery.

        WASHINGTON (AP)---Following
        is the text of a telephone
        conversation between President
        Kennedy, speaking from the White
        House, and astronaut John H.
        Glenn Jr., aboard the destroyer
        Noa:

        Mr. Kennedy: Hello?

        Glenn: Hello, sir.

        Mr. Kennedy: Colonel?

        Glenn: This is Col. Glenn.

        Mr. Kennedy: Listen, Colonel,
        we are really proud of you, and
        I must say you did a wonderful
        job.

        Glenn: Thank you, Mr. President.

        Mr. Kennedy: We are glad you
        got down in good shape. I have
        just been watching your father and
        mother on television, and they
        seem very happy

        Glenn: It was a wonderful trip---almost
        unbelievable thinking back
        on it right now. But it was really
        tremendous.

        Mr. Kennedy: Well, I am coming
        down to Canaveral on Friday, and
        hope you will come up to Washington
        on Monday or Tuesday, and
        I will be looking forward to seeing
        you there.

        Glenn: Fine, I will certainly look
        forward to it.

        CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI)---Thousands
        of well-wishers from all
        around the nation gathered around
        America's portal to space when
        John Glenn Jr. carried out his
        epoch-making orbital flight three
        limes around the earth.

        Some in this big rooting section
        yelled encouragement as the astronaut's
        mighty rocket thundered
        into a cloudless sky. Others gasped
        their appreciation of the spectacle.
        Still others stood in mute amazement.

        On a hard-packed stretch of
        beach several miles south of the
        launch site, there blossomed on the
        eve of the flight a small village
        of automobiles, trailers and bunk-equipped
        trucks.

        Some spectators caught some
        pre-firing rest in sleeping bags.
        Others huddled around campfires,
        drinking coffee and passing the
        time in conversation.

        Teen-agers, freed by a relaxation
        of parental rules, spent the pre-dawn
        hours acting like teen-agers.
        Portable and automobile radios
        blared twist music to the beat of
        the surf.

        License plates were here from
        New England and New York, the
        Midwest, the Far West and from
        all parts of the Southeast.

        Some of the spectators were vacationers
        whose time off fortunately
        coincided with the much-delayed
        space shot. Others were retired
        people, some of whom had
        spent long weeks here waiting for
        the big day.

        Those who could wangle motel
        rooms in "Missiletown" rose early
        and walked to the beach with binoculars,
        sandwiches and other
        paraphernalia needed to watch the
        big missile take off.

        During the waiting period, children
        of all sizes gathered shells,
        waded at surf's edge, chased each
        other through the sand.

        This ebb and flow to the beach
        had been going on since early
        December, when the Glenn shot
        was first scheduled. It reached its
        height when word went out late
        Monday that everything was in
        "go" condition.

        After Glenn's spacecraft disappeared
        at the end of a curling
        white vapor trail, the birdwatchers
        strolled quietly off beaches, leaving
        them virtually deserted.

        The cluster of temporary quarters
        faded from view like a nomad
        camp.

        Most of the spectators headed
        for television sets to watch coverage
        of the remainder of the trip.

        SPACE hero John Glenn
        told a Congressional
        committee in Washington
        yesterday about his religious
        faith. He said:

        "My peace has been
        made with my Maker
        for a number of years.

        It would be foolish to
        assert that God could be
        pin-pointed in Space.

        Just because I have ridden
        above the atmosphere,
        I don't know the nature of
        God any more than anyone
        else.

        I cannot say that while
        I was in orbit I prayed. I
        was pretty busy.

        People in the past have
        tried to put words in my
        mouth on this subject.

        I feel every man should
        live his life as though every
        day might be his last.

        My religion is not of the
        fire-engine type to be called
        on only in
        an emergency."

        THE Voice from Space spoke
        coolly, almost gaily . . . the
        voice of John Glenn giving a four-hour
        running commentary on a
        whirl around the world in which he
        saw three sunsets and three
        dawns.

        As the 40-year-old American astronaut
        flipped over oceans and continents yesterday,
        he told a tense world of the things
        he saw and the things that happened to
        him.

        * HE SPOKE of the "tremendous view" of the
        Canary Isles . . . of Africa . . . of the Indian
        Ocean.

        * HE SPOKE of seeing
        the lights which
        people in night-time
        Perth, Australia,
        switched on to welcome
        him as he passed overhead
        . . . and he expressed
        his thanks for it.

        * HE SPOKE from
        time to time of his
        own emotions. . . . "I
        feel fine" and "I feel
        real good."

        * HE SPOKE of his
        Spacecraft. He ran
        into some trouble with
        the equipment which
        kept the capsule flying
        in the right position.
        But he could right any
        "tilt" himself. And as
        he went into his third
        orbit of the globe, he
        reported: "No problems
        at all now."

        Glenn, the first American
        to orbit the Earth, was
        hurled into the air from the
        launching pad at Cape Canaveral,
        Florida, at 2.47 p.m.
        British time.

        His Spacecraft was hoisted
        into Space by a 130-ton,
        93ft.-long Atlas rocket. It
        was a smooth take-off . . .

        Glenn had waited sixty-three
        days for this great
        moment. There had been
        so many postponements---and
        even yesterday there
        were delays.

        ## Begun

        But all frustration was
        forgotten as Glenn, in
        Friendship 7, rose to the
        skies.

        Two minutes after launching
        and at a height of
        twenty miles, the "booster"
        rocket fell away, as
        planned.

        Seconds later, Glenn
        pressed the button that
        "kicked" his Space capsule
        free of the rest of the
        rocket.

        Friendship 7, out in
        Space, curved up into orbit
        over the Bermudas. The
        round-the-world hop had
        safely begun . . .

        Riding the far skies unseen,
        Glenn kept sending
        back a series of comments
        on his flights to ground
        control at Cape Canaveral
        and at check points on his
        route.

        The Spacecraft was
        whirling up to 100 miles
        above the Earth and was
        hitting a speed of 17,500
        miles an hour when Glenn
        reported:

        "The view is tremendous,
        and I feel fine."

        As the Earth's gravity
        lost its pull, Glenn became
        weightless in his Spacecraft
        cabin. But he was
        resting comfortably on
        foam cushions and said
        that pressure in the cabin
        was [...]

        Coming over the Canary
        [...] in the Atlantic off the
        African coast, he said the
        horizon was a brilliant
        blue. And he added:

        "I have a beautiful view
        of the African coast."

        Then the Atlantic Ocean
        slipped into dimness behind
        him and he was over
        Africa . . . over Kano,
        Nigeria. Now he reported:
        "I am feeling comfortable."

        Twenty-eight minutes
        after launching, Glenn was
        over the Southern Sudan
        and entering the dark side
        of the Earth over the
        Indian Ocean---the end of
        his first "day" in Space.

        Two minutes later, at
        3.20 p.m.---he crossed the
        East African coast and
        swept over the Indian
        Ocean.

        He was then travelling at
        17,545 mph . . . crossing
        the Indian Ocean towards
        Australia.

        It was time for a snack.
        Glenn ate from two small
        tubes of food.

        As Glenn hurtled towards
        the west coast of Australia,
        the lights of Perth were
        lit to welcome him and give
        him a landmark.

        He sent a message to a
        checkpoint in Australia
        that he had seen the "very
        bright lights," and he
        added:

        "Thank everybody for
        turning them on."

        And he went on:

        "I am doing real well up
        here. . . . I am having
        no problems
        at all."

        Glenn later reported that
        he was crossing the Pacific,
        flying towards Hawaii.

        He saw a SUNRISE as
        his Spacecraft approached
        the Californian coast.

        At this time---4.09 p.m.---officials
        at Cape Canaveral
        reported that the cabin
        temperature in the Spacecraft
        had gone a little
        higher to 105-108 degrees
        Fahrenheit.

        ## Glowing

        "This does not appear to
        be any problem at this
        time," the officials added.

        Reporting to a control
        base in Mexico, Glenn said
        he had seen "some small
        particles" near his capsule
        . . . moving at the same
        speed and glowing in the
        sunrise.

        He also reported some
        "minor" difficulties with
        his flight control system,
        and said he was now flying
        on a form of automatic
        pilot.

        At 4.15 p.m. Glenn completed
        his first orbit of the
        Earth. His world-girdling
        time was 88 minutes 29
        seconds . . . almost precisely
        as expected.

        ## Second

        On he went on the
        second circuit . . . out over
        the Atlantic again . . . over
        Africa again . . . and entering
        night again over the
        Indian Ocean. He reported:

        "No troubles at all.
        Smooth and easy.
        Flying very nicely."

        But soon afterwards he
        was saying he had trouble
        with the automatic pilot
        and was drifting about 20
        degrees from side to side.

        On he went . . . over Australia
        . . . over the Pacific.
        As he was ending his
        second orbit, Glenn had to
        take a big decision. Should
        he go on for the third
        orbit?

        Again Glenn used
        manual control to stop his
        Spacecraft "yawing" from
        side to side, and then reported:
        "Having no trouble
        controlling. All very
        smooth. . . ."

        Expanding on his report
        of sighting "small particles"
        after crossing the
        west coast of the United
        States, Glenn said:

        "The only really unusual
        thing so far were little
        luminous particles around
        the capsule, just thousands
        of them . . . just after
        sunrise over the Pacific."

        His control problem
        arose again. He was too
        busy controlling the Spacecraft
        to carry out some of
        the tests he was to have
        made, and the yawing of
        the Spacecraft was using
        up extra fuel needed to
        correct its course.

        ## Details

        It was a question
        whether he would have
        enough for a third orbit.

        But Glenn decided to go
        for a third orbit, though
        he had to continue controlling
        his capsule by hand.

        Passing over Point
        Arguello, California, Glenn
        told fellow-astronaut Wally
        Schirra on the ground:

        "I feel real good
        Wally. No problems
        at all."

        As Friendship 7 flashed
        overhead, Schirra gave
        Glenn new details of when
        to fire his retro-rockets for
        any selected emergency
        landing.

        As Glenn passed over
        Bermuda for the third time
        he reported he felt fine
        and everything was going
        OK.

        ## Waiting

        And as he streaked over
        Woomera, Australia, for
        the third and last time,
        the American Navy was
        waiting in the Atlantic
        area where he was expected
        to land, in the sea.

        As Friendship 7 neared
        the end of its third circuit
        of the Earth, Glenn reported
        that his flight
        control system was causing
        the Spacecraft to
        "drift"---but then it
        appeared to have corrected
        itself.

        He said it was more
        difficult than he had
        anticipated to judge his
        drift through his periscope.

        BUT HE MADE IT.

        ## Down

        At the end of his third
        orbit Glenn fired his
        braking rockets. It was
        7.20 p.m.

        Down he came. In five
        minutes his Spacecraft's
        speed was cut from about
        17,500 m.p.h. to 270 m.p.h.
        In diving back into the
        atmosphere the astronaut
        came within the powerful
        tug of the Earth's gravity.

        Friendship 7 landed in
        the Caribbean Sea 7.43
        last night. A destroyer
        picked up Glenn at 8.01.

        On the Spaceshot base
        President Kennedy decorated
        Glenn with the Distinguished
        Service Medal of
        the National Space Administration.

        Colonel Glenn presented
        the President with a
        Spaceman's helmet. But
        the President who dislikes
        hats soon tucked it under
        his arm.

        Mirror Science Editor, Cape Canaveral, Friday

        SPACE conqueror John Glenn came
        unflappably today through a roaring
        welcome by a crowd of 100,000 and a ceremony
        in which he was decorated by
        President Kennedy for his bravery and
        skill.

        But then he spoke of the ONE AGONISING
        MOMENT on his great flight when his calm deserted
        him . . . when he feared hls Spaceship,
        Friendship 7, was about to burn up.

        It was as the Spaceship was re-entering the
        Earth's atmosphere for its descent into the sea,
        Glenn told a Press conference here tonight.

        Up to that point it had been all "go"---the
        Spaceman's word for "Everything fine."

        He had fired the braking rockets which would
        help to bring down Friendship 7.

        Then came "my most anxious moment as the
        fireballs began to fly."

        Dropping into the Earth's atmosphere, Friendship
        7 ran into air friction which
        generated a heat of 3,000 degrees
        Fahrenheit.

        "There was a bright orange glow
        outside the window," said Glenn. "It
        became apparent something was
        breaking up. . . .

        "Pieces were flaming very brightly
        as they came past the window."

        For a breathless moment Glenn
        thought some vital part of his Spaceship had
        burned away.

        But then he realised that the "flaming pieces"
        were the straps of the package which had contained
        the braking rockets.

        And he was further reassured when the Spaceship's
        parachute blossomed out for the glide
        down to the sea.

        "That parachute," said Glenn,
        "was just about the prettiest little
        old sight you ever saw in your life."

        ## 'Warm'

        In the heat caused by atmospheric
        friction, he added, it was "pretty
        warm" in his Friendship Spaceship.

        That was why, he revealed,
        he got out of the
        "wrong exit" of Friendship
        7 after it was hoisted
        on board a destroyer.

        He emerged from a side-panel---which
        he blew open
        himself---instead of the top
        hatch, which would have
        taken longer.

        "I had been sweating
        very profusely . . . and for
        long enough," said Glenn.

        What was the most spectacular
        thing he saw in
        Space? "It was ALL
        SPECTACULAR up there,"
        said the Spaceman.

        ## 'Brain'

        Turning from his description
        of his flight, Colonel
        Glenn told the Press conference:
        "I want to introduce
        the real power and
        brain in my household."

        And he introduced his
        wife, Anna.

        Earlier in the day, Glenn
        had been reunited with
        Anna and his children,
        David and Carolyn, who
        flew to Cape Canaveral in
        a Presidential plane.

        More than 100,000 wildly
        cheering people lined his
        route along Cocoa Beach
        on his way from an airfield
        to the Spaceshot base at
        Cape Canaveral.

        From GEORGE FALLOWS
        New York, Tuesday

        ANNA GLENN, petite
        brunette wife of America's
        Space hero, never doubted that
        her husband's trip would be a
        success.

        Smiling, Mrs. Glenn tonight told
        reporters outside her home in Arlington,
        Virginia:

        "I think I was worried some of the
        time, but faith makes things look right---like
        everything is going to
        be fine."

        She added: "This is the
        most wonderful day for my
        family. The children are
        so proud of their father."

        For handsome Dave
        Glenn, the astronaut's sixteen-year-old
        son, "it was
        the greatest day of my life."

        Earlier, Dave, sitting by
        one of three television sets
        at the Glenn home, had
        tracked every mile of his
        father's historic journey on
        charts supplied by Dad.

        Also looking in, but "too
        excited to sit still," was
        Glenn's 14-year-old daughter
        Carolyn.

        With them was a small
        group of friends, including
        the Rev. Frank Erwin, the
        Presbyterian pastor of the
        deeply religious Glenn
        family.

        As requested by the 40-year-old
        astronaut, none of
        the family left the house
        during the flight.

        But Pastor Erwin came
        out to talk to a crowd of
        reporters, television
        cameramen and well-wishing
        neighbours.

        ## Silent

        He said that the family,
        who spoke to Colonel Glenn
        by direct telephone to the
        capsule forty-five minutes
        before "blast-off," were
        "overjoyed" at the successful
        launching.

        At the moment of "lift-off",
        all was quiet in the
        living-room, he said.

        "Nobody said anything.
        It was no time to talk.
        There were prayers, but
        they were silent," he added.

        There were prayers, too,
        In New Concord, Ohio, at
        the home of the astronaut's
        parents.

        ## Welcome

        There, too, three television
        sets, each tuned to
        a different service, were
        closely watched so that
        nothing of the flight would
        be missed.

        The Mayor of Concord
        was busy planning a welcome
        for the brave and
        modest Marine Lieutenant-Colonel.

        Glenn, the typical "All-American
        man"---from his
        crew-cut red hair to his
        pull-on shoes---was born in
        the town.

        Already a hero there---because
        of his distinguished
        war record---Glenn is sure
        to get a fabulous reception.

        # Mystery of Glenn Flight: Glowing 'Gems' in Space

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
        Strange specter in space: Astronaut
        John Glenn and his spacecraft,
        surrounded by thousands of
        glowing particles.

        It began at sunrise over the
        Pacific Ocean as Glenn sped toward
        the United States on his first
        of three orbits. Minutes later he
        reported:

        "The only really unusual thing
        so far (besides a problem in steering)
        were the little particles, luminous
        particles around the capsule---just
        thousands of them---right at
        sunrise over the Pacific."

        Glenn said the little particles
        seemed to be traveling right along
        with him.

        Speculation began. What was
        this mysterious shadow?

        Were the particles meteorites
        and space debris? Why would they
        glow?

        Or were they bits of dust from
        the heat shield of the spaceship,
        reflecting sunlight?

        Or were they the lost needles of
        Project West Ford, the plan to put
        a belt of tiny wires into orbit
        around the earth to act as a reflector
        for radio and television signals?

        It is not likely that the shower
        Glenn saw was the needles because
        they were put into a higher orbit
        and very likely did not spread because
        the package carrying them
        failed to open.

        Or was this some new magic
        that nature had dreamed up to
        confound man's first steps away
        from his world?

        Some things can be deducted.
        The particles seemed to be traveling
        with Glenn in his orbit. That
        would likely mean that they came
        somehow from the spaceship itself
        and had the same speed, the same
        orbit.

        Glenn noticed them at sunrise
        when they glowed. So they likely
        reflected sunlight, rather than
        having a glow of their own.

        One source close to the Mercury
        project offers one of the simplest
        and most plausible explanations:

        One of the cooling devices in the
        spacecraft, which uses water to
        remove heat, vents the water into
        space through an exhaust tube.
        This would produce a water vapor
        in space, a vapor moving with the
        spacecraft.

        And these droplets, frozen into
        crystals in the frigidity of space,
        caught the light as the sun rose.

        # Kennedy Call To Glenn in Space No Go

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
        One minor failure---a Presidential
        telephone call that didn't go
        through---was disclosed in the wake
        of John Glenn's three-orbital flight
        around the world.

        Federal space agency officials
        said original plans called for President
        Kennedy to pick up an ordinary
        phone in the White House
        and, through the Mercury control
        communications system in Canaveral,
        talk by radio with Glenn in
        outer space.

        The President was supposed to
        converse with the astronaut during
        his first orbit while he was
        over Florida.

        However, something went wrong
        at the communications end in
        Washington and the call was never
        made.

        The reason for the failure is being
        investigated.

        # N.Y. '40-Plus Club' Hails Glenn as Hero

        NEW YORK (AP) --- Astronaut
        John H. Glenn Jr. is a hero to
        people in many parts of the world,
        but he's an extra-special hero to
        New York's "Forty Plus Club."

        "In addition to conquering space
        Colonel Glenn has endeared himself
        eternally in the hearts of all
        men in America who have had difficulty
        finding re-employment due
        to age discrimination," a club
        statement said.

        "Glenn, over 40, accomplished a
        miraculous feat demanding the
        keenest reactions, mentality, skills
        and ability.

        "Forty-plus salutes the man who
        carried this message around the
        world --- when you want a real
        man to do a man's job, send a man
        over 40."

        # Astronaut Saves Diver, With Assist From Glenn

        GRAND TURK ISLAND, Bahamas
        (AP)---Astronaut Scott Carpenter
        rescued a skin diver with an
        assist from John H. Glenn Jr.

        The man, whose name was not
        disclosed, had dived to see how deep
        he could go without a tank of air,
        Carpenter said. He went down 110
        feet, but apparently became unconscious
        at a depth of 80 feet.

        Carpenter, swimming with the
        man from a local divers club, had
        accompanied him down.

        Carpenter brought the man to
        the surface and Glenn helped pull
        him in. The man revived immediately.

        Glenn was taking time out from
        physical examinations and giving
        details of his flight to officials.

        WASHINGTON, FEB. 20

        The United States sent Lieutenant-Colonel
        John Glenn triumphantly into
        orbit three times round the earth today
        and recovered him "hale and hearty"
        from the sea near Puerto Rico five hours
        14 minutes after his take-off from Cape
        Canaveral. The flight was as nearly
        perfect as anyone could have expected
        and, completed within the sight and
        hearing of the world, was a tremendous
        triumph for the United States.

        The nation watched on television and
        much of the world listened to the Voice
        of America as Colonel Glenn, his past
        frustrations forgotten, exchanged a
        stream of technical information and
        friendly talk with his fellow astronauts
        stationed at tracking stations round the
        globe.

        ## NINE HOURS INSIDE

        All the most crucial moments of the
        flight---take-off, attainment of orbit, reentry
        into the earth's atmosphere and
        recovery from the sea---went perfectly
        and the only trouble of any sort, which
        affected the attitude control system, was
        not serious and did not interfere with
        the flight.

        It was just five minutes after 3 o'clock
        this afternoon (Eastern Standard Time)
        when the nation received the news that
        Colonel Glenn, describing his own condition
        as "excellent", had been landed
        in the Freedom VII capsule on the deck
        of the destroyer Noa. He had then been
        almost exactly nine hours in the capsule,
        which he entered at Cape Canaveral
        before dawn.

        He was being taken to Grand Turk
        Island, in the Bahamas, after being
        "debriefed" and medically examined.

        ## "REAL FIREBALL"

        As Colonel Glenn re-entered the
        earth's atmosphere the heat shield heated
        to a temperature of about 3,000°.
        Observing it through his periscope, he
        commented over the radio: "Boy, that
        was a real fireball." He said the retrorockets,
        when fired, felt as though they
        were sending him "clear back to
        Hawaii".

        Colonel Glenn made a point of insisting
        that he was ready for a third orbit.
        "I am go for another orbit", he said,
        helping to resolve the doubts of officials
        on the ground. The bulk of his conversation
        with the ground consisted of a
        string of figures and facts largely unintelligible
        to the layman, but it was
        punctuated with such comments as, "I
        am feeling real well up here. All systems
        are go. I am having no problems."

        Speaking of the trouble he had in controlling
        the spacecraft at one point,
        Glenn said: "Getting some erratic indications
        in all axes . . . over-yawed to the
        right . . . low-yaw right".

        ## "FLIGHT CHIT"

        Over Muchea, Australia, on the third
        orbit Glenn radioed to astronaut
        Cooper: "Hey, Gordon, I want to send
        a message. Tell the marine commandant
        I have four hours of required flight time
        and request that a flight chit be prepared
        for me."

        The scene on the recovery ship could
        not be seen on television, of course, and
        had not been described in detail by this
        evening. Most of the reporters attached
        to the recovery forces were on board the
        aircraft carrier Randolph, and were
        therefore not present when Colonel
        Glenn stepped from the capsule on
        board the destroyer Noa.

        All the information available came in
        brief reports from the Mercury control
        centre.

        The complexity of today's operation,
        the volume of information relayed, and
        above all the scope of the flight almost
        defy description. In the course of his
        orbits, for example, Colonel Glenn
        saw three dawns and three nightfalls,
        crossed the International Date Line
        three times, passed three times from
        winter into summer, and crossed the
        Equator six times.

        ## "I FEEL FINE"

        His heartbeats, his blood pressure, his
        reaction to four hours of weightlessness,
        his ability to move his head, to eat from
        special containers, and to control the
        attitude of the cone-shaped Mercury
        capsule were among the information
        monitored by a system of 60,000 route
        miles of communications facilities; and,
        as if this was not enough, Colonel Glenn
        found time to thank the citizens of
        Perth, Australia, for turning on their
        lights for him, to search the skies for
        views of Orion and Sirius, and to
        remark: "I feel fine; the view is
        tremendous."

        It was America's day and the nation
        basked in justifiable pride. Americans
        felt on equal terms, whether rightly or
        not, with the Soviet Union and one
        Senator spoke for many when he said:
        "I think the Russians are going to find
        that we not only have the capacity to
        come up from behind, but also to forge
        ahead as front runner".

        WASHINGTON, FEB. 20

        As soon as it was known that Colonel
        Glenn, the American space pilot, had
        been picked up, President Kennedy
        expressed "the great happiness and
        thanksgiving of all of us" that he had
        returned safely to earth.

        Mr. Kennedy said that Colonel Glenn
        and the other astronauts were the sort
        of Americans of whom everyone could
        be most proud. The President recalled
        that Colonel Glenn, when a test pilot,
        had raced the sun across the United
        States and had lost. "Today", said
        the President, "he won."

        Mr. Kennedy will go to Cape
        Canaveral on Friday morning to
        offer his personal congratulations to
        Colonel Glenn and there will be a
        triumphal parade in Washington. The
        President telephoned his congratulations
        to Colonel Glenn this evening and later
        to his wife.

        Mrs. Glenn said it was the happiest
        day of her life and Colonel Glenn's
        parents made a similar comment.

        Vice-President Johnson set off for the
        Bahamas and Mercury officials, level-headed
        to the end, said that there was
        still a long way to go. The rest of the
        nation allowed itself some hours of well
        earned relaxation and mutual congratulation.

        # RUNNING COMMENTARY FROM OUTER SPACE

        From Our Own Correspondent, Washington, Feb. 20

        The huge Atlas D missile was
        launched from Cape Canaveral at
        9.47 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
        (14.47 G.M.T.) The first orbit was
        completed as 11.20; the second at 12.54;
        and, after discussion between Colonel
        Glenn and the Mercury control centre,
        it was decided that a third orbit should
        be made.

        This was the maximum distance
        envisaged and the decision was taken
        in spite of "minor difficulties" reported
        by the astronaut soon after he began
        the second orbit.

        The trouble was in the attitude control
        system, which functioned imperfectly
        when manually operated. However,
        Colonel Glenn was still able to control
        the craft with an alternative semi-manual
        system.

        Colonel Glenn's day had begun at
        2 a.m. with a breakfast of eggs, steak,
        orange juice, toast, and coffee substitute.
        Just after 6 o'clock, clad in his silvery
        space suit, he climbed smilingly into the
        capsule perched some 80ft. above the
        ground on top of the Atlas D missile.
        The long count-down proceeded with
        interruptions here and there for technical
        adjustments, all of which turned out
        to be minor---a broken bolt, a brief
        electrical failure, a fault in the radar
        system---but the early-morning sky was
        overcast and a delay might have been
        necessary in any case.

        ## FINAL FAULT

        With the count-down at T minus 22
        minutes (22 minutes before launching) a
        fault developed in the liquid oxygen
        fuelling system and for several minutes
        the prospect was uncertain. Soon, however,
        all was well again. Cold air from
        the north had dispersed the low cloud
        cover, the astronaut reported that his
        capsule was ready and in the terminology
        of space men, "all systems were
        go".

        Relentlessly the count-down reached
        zero. A two or three second pause for
        ignition, and then at 9.47, with a shattering
        roar, the 95ft. structure rose majestically
        from the pad, its white-hot exhaust
        flames scaring the sky.

        The Atlas, which has not been the
        most reliable rocket in the past, performed
        perfectly today. Colonel Glenn
        maintained a continuous conversation
        with the Mercury control centre on the
        ground, where Commander Alan
        Shepard, America's first astronaut,
        was talking to him. One minute after
        lift-off Colonel John Powers, of the
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
        relayed Colonel Glenn's
        report that all was well in spite of some
        vibration.

        The astronaut's voice was heard over
        public address systems within two or
        three minutes---a flood of technical
        checks of fuel, telemetry, cabin pressure
        and other data. As he swept towards the
        so-called "keyhole in the sky", through
        which he had to pass if orbit was to be
        achieved, he reported the various events
        of the flight, the booster fell away, the
        capsule separated from the rocket and
        swung round so that the blunt end of
        the cone faced forward. Then came the
        crucial announcement, 13 minutes after
        launch, that he had become the first
        American to go into orbit.

        The capsule was then travelling at
        17,545 miles an hour in an orbit whose
        perigee (nearest point to earth) was about
        100 miles and whose apogee (farthest
        point from earth) was about 160 miles.

        The two most difficult operations of
        the flight---launching and orbit---had
        been achieved, and the relief of all
        concerned could be detected.

        ## FOOD OVER NIGERIA

        The stream of information from
        Colonel Glenn continued, interspersed
        with comments about the beautiful
        views. Contact was reported from
        Bermuda; the Canary Islands ("I am
        very comfortable . . . the horizon is a
        brilliant blue"); Kano, Nigeria (where
        he ate his first food); a ship in the
        Indian Ocean ("I am doing very well
        up here . . . no trouble at all"); and
        Muchea, Australia (where he saw "very
        bright lights", identified for him as
        Perth). "Thank everybody for turning
        them on, will you?" he asked his colleague
        Gordon Cooper on the ground.
        "Roger, I will", came the reply,

        Woomera, Australia, was obscured by
        clouds but he was reported to be in
        "completely normal" condition. By
        11.09 he was in touch with the station
        at Guaymas, Mexico, and although the
        cabin temperature had risen from 105°
        to 108°, this was not considered a matter
        of concern. As he approached the coast
        of the United States he reported
        luminous particles passing his window
        in the sunrise.

        The second orbit began when the capsule
        passed over Bermuda again and, in
        spite of the minor trouble with the attitude
        controls, all was well. His condition
        was reported to be "excellent" and his
        attitude "good". Colonel Powers
        declared: "He is working hard as a test
        pilot". High winds in the Indian Ocean
        prevented the launching of high-intensity
        flares, which it was hoped he would see,
        but this did not interfere with his progress.
        By 12.54 the second orbit was
        over.

        Commander Shepard, at the Mercury
        control system, greeted Colonel Glenn
        at 12.56 with "Good afternoon, Seven",
        and the third orbit proceeded much
        as its predecessors until 2.20. At
        this point, over the west coast of the
        United States, another crucial stage of
        the flight was successfully executed---the
        firing of the retro-rockets to slow
        down the capsule before it reentered the
        earth's atmosphere.

        ## HATCH BLOWN

        Direct communication with the capsule
        was briefly lost as it reentered the
        atmosphere because of an ionization
        process, but beacon signals were
        received. The drogue parachute opened
        to retard the capsule further and then
        the main parachute billowed out to lower
        Colonel Glenn into the sea, where
        he landed at 2.43.

        The flight had thus taken four hours
        56 minutes but it was another 22
        minutes before those watching were able
        to breathe entirely freely. The capsule
        landed in the south Atlantic some 200
        miles north-west of Puerio Rico, six
        miles from the nearest ship, the Noa;
        he was eventually hoisted on to her
        deck.

        There were two minor hitches during
        the flight. The first concerned what
        seemed to be a faulty signal indicating
        that the heat shield had become separated
        from the capsule during re-entry,
        and the retro-pack was therefore
        retained in position to hold the heat
        shield for longer than would have otherwise
        been done.

        The second hitch concerned Colonel
        Glenn's egress from the capsule after it
        had been picked up. It had been decided
        in advance that if possible he should
        come out through the narrow neck of
        the cone-shaped capsule to avoid, if
        possible, the slight warping effect which
        would result from blowing off the
        hatch. However he had difficulty in
        trying to remove part of the instrument
        panel to come out through the neck and
        the bolts of the hatch were blown to get
        him out quickly.

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Wednesday Morning.---A
        helicopter took Colonel Glenn
        to Grand Turk island, where he landed
        at about 2 a.m. G.M.T.---Reuter.

        Moscow, Feb. 20.---The Soviet news
        agency Tass reported Colonel Glenn's
        space flight in its Russian service some
        34 minutes after the launching at Cape
        Canaveral.---Reuter

        ## THE QUEEN'S MESSAGE

        The Queen last night sent a message
        of congratulation to President Kennedy,
        It read:---

        "On behalf of my peoples throughout
        the Commonwealth, I send you my warmest
        congratulations on Colonel Glenn's
        historic achievement."

        The Prime Minister last night sent a
        telegram to President Kennedy congratulating
        him and Colonel Glenn on
        the achievement.

        # Parade, Crowds to Greet Astronaut in New York

        NEW YORK (AP)---Ticker tape,
        water salutes from fireboats,
        school-free youngsters, city officials
        and thousands of citizens will
        be welcoming America's spacemen
        to New York City Thursday.

        Guest of honor, of course, is Lt
        Col John H. Glenn Jr., the the nation's
        first astronaut to circle the globe.

        With him are his six fellow astronauts
        of the Project Mercury
        program and members of their
        families.

        Details of the welcome---which
        city officials think may well be
        the greatest of its type ever staged
        here---were disclosed at a news
        conference.

        The Board of Education said it
        will give a holiday to children
        attending schools near the routes
        which the spacemen will travel
        in a 26-car motorcade which will
        roll slowly through the canyons of
        lower Broadway for New York's
        traditional ticker tape shower for
        highly honored guests.

        Awaiting spacemen on the steps
        of city hall will be Mayor and Mrs.
        Robert F. Wagner.

        Glenn also has been invited to
        visit the United Nations during his
        New York visit. The invitation was
        extended by U Thant, acting
        secretary general.

        By RONALD BEDFORD

        AMERICA
        launched a new
        rocket last night---in
        an attempt to
        land an instrument
        on the moon.

        The gold-plated Spaceship---Ranger IV---was
        blasted off by a two-decker
        Atlas-Agena
        rocket.

        Soon it was streaking at
        24,500 m.p.h. on its 60-hour
        journey.

        The Ranger is expected
        to reach the moon on
        Thursday.

        It has two missions:---

        1) To take pictures of
        the moon every [...]
        seconds as it [...]

        2) To [...]
        [...]
        [...]
        surface.

        This "igloo" is [...]
        to measure moonquakes---the
        lunar equivalent of
        earthquakes---and to [...]
        temperature.

        # Satellite Will Crash On Dark Side

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)
        The United States launched
        an inquisitive scientific probe
        toward the moon Monday but
        a failure in a timing device in
        the spacecraft apparently
        ruined a major portion of the
        ambitious experiment.

        The spacecraft was expected to
        hit the dark side of the moon at
        2:55 p.m. CET Thursday.

        Scientists abandoned plans to try
        to correct the faulty "brain" in
        the Ranger 4 spacecraft.

        The shot was launched from here
        at 3:50 p.m. EST (9:50 p.m. CET).

        After beaming a series of signals
        from ground stations in an effort
        to steer the gold and silver craft
        onto its intended course, officials
        at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
        Goldstone, Calif., decided this was
        fruitless.

        A statement said:

        "Since Ranger 4 has not responded
        to commands from earth stations,
        a decision has been made
        not to send the spacecraft mid-course
        or terminal maneuver commands."

        The feeling was that any attempt
        at sending these commands might
        knock the vehicle off its present
        collision course with the moon.

        If the trouble with the payload's
        control and telemetry system---the
        result of an errant timing device---could
        have been overridden by
        ground signals, officials said earlier,
        there was still a possibility
        Ranger 4 could have achieved its
        main missions. These were to take
        closeup television pictures of the
        moon and eject an instrument
        package for landing on the bright
        side of the lunar surface to record
        moon quakes and meteorite hits.

        These goals cannot now be accomplished,
        the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory reported.

        Nevertheless, the United States
        can take some consolation in the
        fact that it is about to land a
        package on the moon, even though
        it will crash and destroy itself.
        Seven previous U.S. moon failures
        could not claim that much.

        Ranger 4 will impact on the far
        side of the moon---the side never
        seen from the earth except in photographs
        taken by Russia's wide-swinging
        satellite, Lunik III.

        The Soviets also crash-landed the
        Lunik II payload on the moon 2½
        years ago.

        The signals showed the vehicle's
        course would carry it about 900
        miles above the top edge of the
        moon and land it on the back side
        at 8:55 a.m. EST Thursday. The
        impact point will be at a lunar
        latitude of 6 degrees south and
        longitude of 216 degrees east.

        The control malfunction caused
        the spacecraft to tumble through
        space, unable to perform vital functions
        such as locking one antenna
        toward the earth and another
        toward the sun for stabilization.

        As the craft sped away from
        earth, its speed gradually decreased
        from the initial 24,500 miles
        per hour. The continuing pull of
        earth's gravity slowed it to 6,000-mile-an-hour
        clip.

        A spokesman for the Jet Propulsion
        Laboratory, which made
        the craft, said the trouble apparently
        developed in a timer---a clock-like
        electronic device activated a
        few seconds before launching. Its
        purpose was to allow a central
        computer and sequencer to issue
        steering commands to Ranger 4 on
        a precise pre-set timetable in the
        early stage of flight.

        Officials said strong signals were
        still being received from two tracking
        beacons in the payload. These
        were expected to continue to be
        strong for several hours, and then
        begin fading as the batteries
        weakened.

        If Ranger's systems had worked,
        the solar cells would have transformed
        sunlight into energy to
        power the batteries for the trip to
        the moon.

        It is expected the batteries will
        be dead by the time the lunar impact
        occurs.

        The giant Atlas-Agena B rocket
        blasted away from its launching
        pad at 3:50 p.m. (EST) with the
        gold and silver spacecraft tucked
        in its nose.

        The powerful booster worked as
        planned, unleashing the 730-pound
        Ranger 4 on a course toward the
        moon at the planned speed of
        24,500 m.p.h.

        But two hours later the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) reported a malfunction
        had occurred in the spacecraft
        telemetry (radio) system
        making it impossible to determine
        whether Ranger 4 was responding
        to commands sent to it from earth.

        Later, at a news conference,
        William H. Pickering, director of
        NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
        said the problem apparently was
        serious and that the space craft
        probably would not be able to carry
        out most of Its missions.

        Pickering said the official indication
        of trouble came when a
        South African tracking station was
        unable to receive telemetry signals
        radioed from instruments inside the
        body of the spacecraft. However,
        signals were being received from
        two tracking beacons in the
        vehicle.

        MOSCOW (AP) --- The Soviet
        Union launched another satellite,
        Cosmos III.

        Moscow Radio said Cosmos III
        was orbiting the earth every 93.8
        minutes and was carrying sclentific
        instruments plus telemetry
        equipment to radio data back on
        weather and communications.

        The announcement also listed
        the times at which the satellite
        would pass over various cities,
        including New York, Chicago,
        Los Angeles and San Francisco.

        RUSSIAN and other Soviet
        bloc delegates will watch
        Tuesday's attempt to
        launch UK1---Britain's
        first satellite.

        They will be among nearly 100
        members of the United
        Nations Outer Space Committee
        invited to Cape
        Canaveral for the first international
        assault on space---weather
        permitting.

        Security, customarily very severe
        here, has been drastically
        chopped in favour of the Communists,
        who will, apparently,
        have a better view and more
        detailed briefing than any of
        us non-Communists so far.

        Six complex, British-designed
        and British-made instruments
        will ride inside the American-made
        satellite, which will be
        fired into space by an American
        Thor-Delta.

        ## 13 stations

        The instruments were devised at
        London's Imperial College and
        University College and Birmingham
        and Leicester Universities.

        The aim of the project is to seek
        more knowledge of the ionosphere---an
        electrified layer beginning
        three miles above the
        earth and stretching into space---and
        to measure the effects of
        the sun's radiations on it.

        Thirteen stations in Britain, the
        U.S., Chile, Peru, Ecuador,
        South Africa, Australia, and
        Newfoundland will track the
        satellite which is expected to
        orbit for about a year between
        200 and 600 miles above earth.

        [...] task should be tackled in
        [...] stages:

        1) An aircraft capable of
        flying at five times the
        speed of sound to explore the
        working of controls and other
        flight problems in the outer
        fringes of the atmosphere.

        2) A true aero-space machine
        which can fly at nine
        times the speed of sound in the
        outer atmosphere and then
        shoot on under rocket power
        into space.

        A surprising and important
        feature of the "space cell's"
        recommendations is that the
        basic programme would cost no
        more than the proposed new
        generation of aircraft-carriers.
        This would be about £200,000,000.

        Basic research and design
        studies now ordered are well
        within the spending power of
        the Air Ministry and the research
        establishments without
        making heavy demands for
        extra funds.

        The next step must be to convince
        the Treasury that a full
        programme should be started
        and that it would bring worthwhile
        returns.

        The breakthrough on cost
        compared with the prohibitively
        expensive U.S. and Soviet space
        efforts is promised by the
        simpler and more logical R.A.F.
        approach.

        ## Ram-jets

        A machine which could fly
        with highly developed jet engines---probably
        ram-jets, in
        which Britain has the technical
        lead---at high speeds on the
        fringes of space would already
        have overcome much of the propulsive
        effort needed to break
        out into space.

        Comparatively little rocket
        power would then be needed for
        the final stage. Such machines
        could be used time and again.

        A grave national defence requirement
        which has emerged
        in recent months is a basic
        reason behind the Air Ministry's
        decision to achieve space
        flight.

        Both the Russians and the
        Americans are developing a new
        weapon known as NABS---the
        Nuclear Armed Ballistic Satellite.

        This will be an orbiting H-bomb
        of 50 megatons or more
        which, when exploded at an altitude
        of 100 miles, would burn up
        250 square miles of territory
        below.

        Clearly the R.A.F. has the
        responsibility to propose a
        national means of defence
        against such a threat.

        The R.A.F. had its beginning
        with the constitution by
        Royal Warrant 50 years ago today
        of the Royal Flying Corps.
        The R.F.C. was then formed one
        month later on May 13, 1912.

        BRITAIN'S first satellite
        chirruped its way
        across Southern England
        at breakfast time to-day.

        In one minute exactly Ariel---it
        was given this name by Mr.
        Macmillan in New York---hurtled
        across the country
        from Land's End to Southend.

        Scientists tracking it in its
        60-second flight heard "a twittering
        like a couple of toy cage
        birds."

        At 8.15 a.m. Ariel---a set of
        British instruments in an
        American satellite launched
        last night from Cape Canaveral---whipped
        over the coast at
        Land's End and curved towards
        London.

        It passed over Falmouth,
        Plymouth and a spot close to
        Guildford---less than 30 miles
        from London---before hurtling
        on over the sea above Southend.

        ## GONE

        ## In Minute

        Scientists under Dr. Hubert
        Hopkins, senior principal scientific
        officer at the Radio Research
        Station at Datchet,
        Bucks, watched eagerly from
        the tracking station at Winkfield
        Row, Berks.

        And he reported: "She was
        over and gone in a minute."

        Council you see her from the
        street? "No---not with the
        naked eye. But depending on
        visibility it would have been
        possible with a very powerful
        pair of binoculars."

        Ariel was scheduled to pass
        over the country on the same
        trajectory every 101 minutes
        and scientists were standing by
        through the day to watch its
        progress and record every
        "chirrup."

        The signals were coming
        from instruments designed by
        scientists at London's Imperial
        and University Colleges and at
        Birmingham and Leicester Universities.

        First signals began to be
        received at Winkfield 4.42 a.m.
        and went on for 10 minutes.
        This time is about 10 minutes
        later than was expected.

        Signals were picked up for
        the second time at Winkfield,
        this time for 30 minutes beginning
        at 6.31 a.m.

        The satellite was again late,
        indicating that it is travelling
        a little higher than expected.

        # Britain to put up Ariel No. 2

        Express Staff Reporter

        WASHINGTON, Friday.

        BRITAIN and America
        have "well-advanced
        plans" to launch a second
        joint satellite within the
        next 18 months, it was
        announced in Washington
        today.

        Sir Harrie Massey, chairman
        of the Royal International
        Society, said that a
        third satellite would be
        launched after that, but it
        has not yet been decided for
        what experiments it would
        be used.

        In Britain the "singing satellite"
        Ariel should be visible
        through fairly powerful binoculars
        in about 10 days, when its
        orbital flight coincides with
        sunrise and sunset.

        ## LIKE STAR

        A spokesman at the tracking
        station at Winkfield, Berkshire,
        said: "When the sun is in a
        position to light up the satellite
        from below the horizon you
        will be able to spot it zooming
        across the sky like a very fast
        star."

        Ariel, an American capsule
        containing a load of complex
        British-made electronic equipment,
        was launched via an
        American rocket at Cape
        Canaveral on Thursday.

        Ariel is orbiting between 770
        and 240 miles in space at 17,000
        miles an hour. Its first messages
        were received at 4 a.m.

        FURTHER evidence that
        life has existed on
        other worlds in outer
        space and may still exist
        there is put forward by
        scientists today.

        After examining meteorites---lumps
        of stone which have
        fallen in from space---they
        believe they have detected
        the fossilised remains of tiny
        organisms unlike anything
        found on earth.

        A team headed by Professor
        Bartholomew Nagy in New York
        reports new experiments on
        microscopic spherical objects
        covered with spines which were
        found in meteorites.

        "They seem to indicate that
        these are fossilised organised
        structures," say the scientists.

        Even those scientists who
        doubt that the objects were ever
        actually alive admit they represent
        materials from outer space
        from which living things could
        originate. Some of them suspect
        that life may first have arrived
        on earth in this way.

        ## A CLASH

        Professor J. D. Bernal, of
        London University, who has
        examined one of Professor
        Nagy's "fossils," says:---

        "Anyone who has seen it
        under a microscope would be
        inclined to accept its organic
        origin. We may have to face
        the possibility that life is much
        older than the earth and was
        brought from some other part of
        the galaxy or indeed from
        other galaxies."

        In five research reports in the
        journal "Nature" scientists
        clash over how the "fossils"
        arose in outer space.

        After analysing them chemically,
        Dr. Michael Briggs and Dr.
        Barrie Kitto of New Zealand
        report that the world from
        which they came must have had
        water on it and an atmosphere.

        This means it must have
        been at least as big as the
        moon.

        ## THE MOON

        After ruling out Mars and
        Jupiter, Professor Harold Urey---the
        Nobel Prize winner of
        California University---suspects
        that the "fossils" came from
        the moon itself, but reached
        there from the earth in the
        first place.

        He suggests that enormous
        meteorites struck the earth
        after life had developed on it,
        sending up such a cloud of
        debris and water that some
        landed on the moon.

        Small living objects thrown up
        in the water continued to live on
        the moon until it dried up. Then
        bombardment by big meteorites
        there chipped bits off which
        landed back on earth with the
        "fossils" in them.

        Professor Urey believes his
        hunch may be confirmed when
        the first US robot laboratory
        called Ranger, lands on the
        moon and radios back details of
        analysis of samples of the
        crust.

        # BLUE STREAK TO POWER ITALIAN SPUTNIK IN 1966

        By ANGUS MACPHERSON

        BRITAIN'S Blue Streak
        rocket will blast an
        Italian satellite into orbit
        early in 1966.

        And Blue Streak itself will take
        off for its first 150-mile flight
        into space from the Australian
        Woomera range early next
        year.

        The de Havilland-Rolls rocket
        has been grounded for two
        years since the Government
        dropped it as a ballistic missile
        H-bomb carrier in 1960---only a
        few months before it was due
        to be fired.

        But now the "Common Market"
        satellite plan for Europe, using
        Blue Streak, has been agreed
        in detail.

        ## Complete

        Two "pick-a-back" rockets will
        be fitted on Blue Streak to
        turn it into a satellite booster.
        The second stage will be built
        by France, the third by
        Germany.

        With the selection of Italy as
        the satellite builder, the European
        space club is now complete.
        Belgium, Denmark and
        Holland are expected to make
        the ground stations and radio
        equipment to guide the rocket
        and pick up signals.

        Aviation Minister Mr. Peter
        Thorneycroft has thus
        triumphed in a key assignment,
        and ensured that the
        £100,000,000 spent by Britain
        on Blue Streak will not be
        entirely wasted.

        Even so, by the time Blue Streak
        boosts the European satellite
        into orbit, it will be badly out
        of date. In the same year, the
        Americans are due to land a
        three-man crew on the Moon---and
        the Russians may be
        there already.

        # Space ship to land on Britain---in a plane

        Express Staff Reporter

        FRIENDSHIP SEVEN, the
        spacecraft in which
        American astronaut John
        Glenn hurtled round the
        earth, is being flown into
        Britain early this morning.

        The capsule, due at Bovingdon
        airfield, Hertfordshire, in an
        American plane at 5 a.m., is to
        go on exhibition at the Science
        Museum, South Kensington,
        London, for three days,
        beginning today.

        ## TWO TONS

        It weighs nearly two tons and
        sped round the earth (with
        Colonel Glenn inside) at an
        average speed of 17,500 miles an
        hour.

        Science Museum authorities
        will open the special exhibition
        to the public at noon today---so
        a hustle will begin as soon as
        the capsule reaches Britain.

        # 'SURGERY IN SPACE' BID TO SAVE MOONSHOT

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Tuesday.

        SCIENTISTS to-day abandoned
        plans to try to
        correct a faulty "brain" in the
        Ranger 4 spacecraft and said
        the vehicle will crash on the
        dark side of the moon on
        Thursday morning.

        The complex 730lb. spacecraft,
        launched from here yesterday
        packed with delicate instruments,
        developed the fault 10 or
        15 minutes after take-off.

        Signals were sent from a
        tracking station last night in
        an attempt to correct the
        trouble with "electronic surgery"
        but they failed to wake
        up the Ranger.

        Officials said that if Ranger
        IV held its present course it
        would travel across the face of
        the moon at a height of about
        900 miles, go "over the top" as
        seen from earth and destroy
        itself on the dark side.

        ## Disappointment

        It would not eject its instrument
        capsule as planned or
        send back television pictures.

        The small instrument capsule,
        cushioned by a balsa wood shell,
        was to have been landed on the
        moon and send back valuable
        information about lunar quakes
        and meteor activity.

        One official here said the
        telemetry signals arriving were
        gibberish and remarked tartly:
        "All we've got is an idiot with
        a radio signal."

        Ranger's speed, 24,500 m.p.h.
        at its fastest soon after
        launching, is gradually decreasing
        and will be a relatively
        slow 6,000 m.p.h. by the
        time it crash lands.

        Ranger 4 marked America's
        10th attempt to send a spacecraft
        to or near the moon.
        None has been successful.

        AT JODRELL BANK a
        spokesman said their radio
        telescope hoped to track later
        the American rocket.

        # Reply to the dumb Ranger

        By RONALD BEDFORD
        Mirror Science Editor

        RUSSIA one up---America
        one down.

        This was the situation
        in the Space League
        Division One yesterday.

        SOVIET scientists successfully
        blasted a Cosmos
        III Spaceship Into orbit
        round the Earth.

        AMERICAN scientists
        abandoned attempts to persuade
        their gold-plated
        Ranger IV Spaceship,
        which "went dumb" during
        the early stages of its
        sixty-hour voyage to the
        Moon, to obey orders.

        Cosmos III, one of a
        series designed to pave the
        way for men to spend a
        week in Space, or for a man
        to voyage round the Moon,
        went off like clockwork---according
        to the Russians.

        In January, when the
        United States sent Ranger
        III hurtling towards the
        Moon, the equipment
        aboard the Spaceship functioned
        well but the ship
        went off course.

        Now Ranger IV is on
        course, but the equipment
        won't work.

        Scientists expect that the
        Spaceship, designed to send
        back to Earth close-up pictures
        of the Moon seen
        through TV cameras, will
        crash-land on the far side
        of the Moon early tomorrow.

        The giant radio telescope
        at Jodrell Bank, near Manchester,
        failed to pick up
        any signal from Ranger IV
        in a four-hour sky search
        early yesterday.

        # Up, up, UP . . 48 miles in a jet

        AN American pilot soared
        48½ miles into the sky
        above California yesterday---adding
        more than
        seven miles to the old
        height record for winged
        aircraft.

        Pilot Joe Walker put his
        X-15 rocket plane into its
        steep climb after being
        dropped from under the
        wing of a B-52 bomber.

        The X-15 zoomed to 3,650
        m.p.h.

        Then Joe shut off the
        engine and "coasted" to
        the record altitude on
        the fringes of Space.

        Only eleven minutes after
        take-off, the plane was
        back.

        Experts found that its
        black paintwork was
        charred by air friction.

        But Joe was "cool and
        comfortable" in a refrigerated
        suit.

        BRITAIN'S first Sputnik
        should blast off
        from Cape Canaveral,
        Florida, tonight.

        The 132 lb. Sputnik was
        planned be launched two
        weeks ago, but a fault was
        found in the fuel system.

        The Sputnik, UK-1, is the
        first of a series of international
        satellites which
        will have a "hitch-hike"
        trip In the nose of an
        American rocket. Britain's
        Space-knight, Sir Harrie
        Massey, 54, and other top
        British scientists will watch
        the Sputnik being
        launched.

        It will go into an egg-shaped
        orbit which will
        hurl it 600 miles from the
        Earth and then bring it
        back within 200 miles. The
        British-made instruments
        in the Sputnik are designed
        to glean facts about the
        ionosphere, an "electric
        blanket" which begins
        about 35 miles above the
        Earth.

        * America staged a
        "Space waterfall" yesterday.

        Scientists at Cape Canaveral
        blasted off a 410-ton
        Saturn rocket, rated the
        biggest in the world---with
        95 tons of water aboard.

        When the rocket was 65
        miles above the Earth, they
        blew it up and the water,
        which had turned to ice,
        showered down in crystals.

        * America's Ranger 4
        rocket, launched
        Monday, is expected to hit
        the moon this afternoon.

        But it will not transmit
        information back to Earth.
        Its instruments have
        stopped working.

        A TECHNICAL fault last
        night held up the
        launching of Britain's first
        satellite---UK 1---from
        Cape Canaveral, Florida.

        The gold-plated satellite
        was due to be shot into
        orbit by an American Thor-Delta
        rocket. But the countdown
        was halted.

        UK 1 is packed with
        British-designed and British-made
        instruments
        which will probe the
        secrets of the sun.

        Late last night it was
        said the satellite might be
        launched today. But some
        sources said blast-off might
        be held up for as long as
        two weeks.

        # 'HAMS' ON THE TRACK

        by Jack Stoneley

        TODAY is count-down for the launching of
        UK-1 --- Britain's very first Earth satellite.

        And from the moment the rocket blasts off
        from Cape Canaveral, Florida---it'll be a job for
        SUPER-HAM!

        All over Britain super-hams --- the amateur radio
        enthuslasts of the Space age---will be operating home-made
        tracking stations in attics, bedrooms and garden
        sheds.

        There are 8,000 hams in Britain and 300,000 in the
        United States.

        Until the first Russian
        satellite went into orbit
        nearly five years ago they
        were quite happy to chit-chat
        to each other over the
        air about ordinary down-to-earth
        things.

        Now the satellites have
        given many of them a new
        interest.

        AT his home in
        Kingsley-avenue,
        Wilmslow, Cheshire --- it
        bristles like a pin-cushion
        with aerials --- super-ham
        Mr. Oliver Heggs (call sign
        G3NLR) showed me his
        equipment --- hundreds of
        pounds worth of war surplus.

        He is one of Britain's
        best-informed amateurs and
        has already tape-recorded
        the bleeps of more than
        twenty Russian and American
        satellites.

        ## In Orbit

        From the moment UK-1
        goes off he might as well
        be up there in orbit himself
        as far as his wife is
        concerned. She'll see very
        little of him.

        With super-ham Ronald
        Norris (call sign [...])
        he'll spend at least three
        hours at night listening for
        UK-1 signals, plotting its
        course, scheming graphs
        and pin-pointing the satellite
        on world maps covering
        every inch of the walls in
        Mr. Heggs's radio "den."

        "There are few 'professional'
        tracking stations,"
        Mr. Heggs told me.

        ## Potential

        "But there are thousands
        of amateurs who could be
        called into action. Their
        tracking potential is tremendous.

        "The moment we hear
        the launching news of
        UK-1 we'll be listening in."

        SO useful is the Space
        research of these
        super-hams that four
        months ago Oscar I --- a
        special satellite just for
        them --- was launched at
        Cape Canaveral.

        Oscar II is expected to go
        into orbit next month.

        So ladies, if you're a
        "bleep-bleep" widow this
        week-end---go easy on Dad.
        He may not be another
        Yuri Gagarin, but he could
        be doing a very useful
        little job up there in the
        spare room.

        # SPACE---HERE WE COME!

        BRITAIN'S first satellite
        will be shot into
        Space from Cape Canaveral,
        Florida, on Tuesday
        night.

        Twice the size of a
        football, it will bleep
        around the world, once
        every 100 minutes for a
        year.

        A model of the
        £200,000 satellite is pictured
        above in the hands
        of Sir Harrie Massey,
        chairman of the British
        National Committee for
        Space Research.

        Sir Harrie, leader of
        the team which designed
        instruments in the satellite,
        said:

        "They will supply useful
        information about
        cosmic-ray activity."

        The satellite will be
        put into outer Space by
        a three-stage American
        Delta rocket.

        Another RUSSIAN
        sputnik, Cosmos II, was
        put into orbit yesterday.
        It is circling the world
        once every 102½ minutes.

        WE'RE in orbit! The first of the Britniks hurtled
        into Space last night and began bleeping out
        scientific facts as it circled the Earth.

        The Britnik---a set of British instruments in an American
        satellite---was launched from the Space base at Cape Canaveral,
        Florida.

        It blasted off with a thunderous roar in the nose of a 90ft.-long
        American Thor-Delta rocket.

        # Check on bleeps

        And soon afterwards British Premier Harold Macmillan, who is visiting
        America, announced in New York that the Britnik's official name would
        be "Ariel."
        Nine British scientists, headed by Sir Harrie Massey, chairman of the
        British National Committee on Space Research,
        watched the Britnik go
        up.

        At first there was a
        hitch. Zero hour was 6
        p.m. British time---but a
        fault in the ground support
        equipment caused an
        hour's delay.

        At 7 p.m. Britnik One
        was on its way.

        And as the bleep-bleep
        signals were picked up
        from its first orbit Sir
        Harrie said: "We are feeling
        very pleased indeed."

        ## Tracked

        The Britnik's signals
        were heard in America and
        Singapore.

        Later, as it continues
        circling the Earth every 100
        minutes or so at heights
        varyring between 200 and
        600 miles, the bleeps will
        be heard at tracking stations
        in Britain.

        Its most northern orbit
        is expected to take it over
        Gretna Green.

        The instruments aboard
        the Britnik were designed
        by scientists at London's
        Imperial and University
        Colleges, and at Birmingham
        and Leicester Universities.

        ## 'Blanket'

        The aim is to study the
        ionosphere---an "electricity
        blanket" which starts
        about thirty-five miles from
        the Earth.

        Information picked up by
        tracking stations all over
        the world will be sent to
        the British scientists for
        investigation.

        * A JAPNIK---an American
        rocket carrying
        Japanese and American
        instruments---did a successful
        straight-up-and-down
        trip yesterday from a base
        at Wallops Island, Virginia.

        * THE FLOPNIK---America's
        Ranger Four Spaceship
        which went "dumb"
        instead of sending back information
        and pictures---crash-landed
        on the far
        side of the Moon yesterday,
        US Space officials said.

        ## Russia

        * A SPUTNIK Earth
        satellite called Cosmos
        Four was sent into orbit by
        the Russians.

        * A TV-NIK satellite
        which will be launched
        by the Americans this summer
        will relay a joint
        ITV-BBC programme to
        the US, it was announced
        yesterday.

        A combined ITV-BBC
        team, headed by Peter
        Dimmock, of the BBC's
        "Sportsview," will produce
        the programme.

        By RONALD BEDFORD, Mirror Science Editor

        RUSSIAN scientists announced yesterday
        that they have brought home
        their latest Space satellite---Cosmos Four,
        which was sent whirling round the Earth
        four days ago.

        The series of four Cosmos satellites
        was launched to investigate the
        effects of radiation in Space.

        ## Blood

        But Cosmos Four is the only one of
        the series to be brought back to Earth.

        And there seems little doubt that it
        was brought home because it was
        carrying living matter---including,
        perhaps, samples of blood and bone-marrow.

        Study of the samples should show
        what would happen to a Spaceman
        who penetrated the dense layer of
        radiation which starts about 250 miles
        from the Earth.

        ## Keen

        The Russians are specially keen to
        get this information, as they plan
        their next "Space Spectaculars"---

        Sending at least two men circuiting
        the Earth for a week or more,
        and---

        Sending a man round the Moon.

        * BRITNIK ONE, the American
        satellite carrying British Space-probe
        equipment---officially
        named Ariel---was
        still going round the
        Earth yesterday.

        * Soviet Space-traveller
        Gherman Titov, 26,
        spent two hours at Prestwick
        (Scotland) Airport
        yesterday on his way to
        America for a conference.
        He said: "I would like to
        visit Britain officially, but
        I have not been asked."

        # Moon Man No 1 faces a VERY cold trip

        By RONALD BEDFORD

        SCIENTISTS have
        trained a giant radio
        "ear" on to the moon---and
        picked up bad news
        for Spacemen.

        Whether the Americans or
        Russians get there first,
        they will find it colder
        than was thought.

        Reports from Moscow yesterday
        say that Russian
        radio astronomers have
        measured the moon's surface
        temperatures.

        ## Drop

        Their instruments show
        that during the moon
        night, temperatures drop
        to minus 312 degrees
        Fahrenheit.

        Previous measurements put
        the coldest temperature
        at about minus 200.

        Freezing point is 32
        degrees.

        During the moon day, the
        surface gets as hot as 239
        degrees Fahrenheit. The
        earlier estimate was
        slightly hotter---250 degrees.
        Water boils at 212
        degrees.

        # Blast-off disaster

        NEW YORK, Tuesday.---America's
        105 ft. tall Centaur
        rocket was launched on its
        maiden flight from Cape
        Canaveral today---and exploded
        in the air.

        It was a severe blow to plans
        to develop the rocket as a "work
        horse" to lift four-ton payloads
        into orbit and send probes to the
        moon, Mars, and Venus.

        Cape Canaveral, Monday

        WHY do Russian rockets hit the Moon
        and photograph the other side of it
        when American rockets do neither?

        Why can Russia put men in Space almost one
        year ahead of the United States, whose Man-in-Space
        rocket was left grounded at Cape
        Canaveral at the week-end because the weather
        turned sour

        These are the questions being asked by millions
        in Britain and the United States after the
        week-end attempt to photograph the Moon by
        TV came unstuck.

        An electrical part failed to lock the TV transmitter
        on to the Earth after the picture started
        coming through.

        Is the reason, as top German rocket scientist
        Professor Eugen Sanger said bluntly yesterday,
        that America's rockets are far too complicated?

        I think Sanger is right---but only partly so.
        Americans love to have lots of gadgets.

        I have not seen inside Yuri Gagarin's Russian
        Spaceship. But I have seen photographs of it.
        The cockpit is clean and simple. Seven sections
        control everything.

        Yet when I looked into the cockpit of a copy
        of Colonel John Glenn's Spaceship today, I found
        almost as many dials, lights, switches, gimmicks
        and gadgets, as in a Transatlantic jet airliner
        cockpit.

        ## Thousands

        There are ten thousand parts and seven miles
        of wiring in the Spaceship alone. The rocket
        has many thousands more.

        Any part can go wrong. Not long ago, a US
        rocket costing £2 million blew up soon after
        launching because of a failure of a mass-produced
        part costing seven shillings.

        Americans had to go in for gadgets because
        they lacked giant booster rockets capable of
        hurling sturdy, uncomplicated equipment into
        Space.

        The Russians concentrated on giant booster
        rockets from the beginning. That is why they
        were the first to orbit dogs and men, hit the
        Moon and photograph it.

        Yet the Russians envy the skill and elaboration
        of America's scientific satellites. With the
        exception of photographing the Moon, the major
        scientific advances in Space have all been
        chalked up by the Americans.

        The Russians have no weather satellites, no
        communications satellites, no Space "eyes" to
        photograph the Earth.

        Now that the Americans have a big booster
        rocket in Saturn---successfully fired for the first
        time last October---they, too, will be able to hurl
        mighty chunks of comparatively simple machinery
        into Space.

        * The Russians have put all their Space eggs
        in the booster basket. The Americans have
        put their eggs in many baskets and broken quite
        a few. But they have learned an awful lot.

        # war in Space

        From Donald Ludlow

        Washington, Sunday.

        A BLUEPRINT for
        war in Space has
        been prepared by the
        US Air Force.

        It envisages Space
        "battleships," Space
        command posts, refuelling
        and repair points.

        And the plan includes at
        least one frightening
        new weapon.

        The Space war blueprint
        is the result of weeks of
        work by the best brains
        of the Pentagon---America's
        High Command---working
        with
        U.S. science and industry.

        ## Secret

        The top secret study was
        made at the direction
        of President Kennedy.

        It has come up with
        one simple objective:
        To move America's
        military into Space.

        A new weapon, the
        LASER, is already being
        developed.

        The name stands for
        "light amplification by
        stimulated emission of
        radiation."

        The principle: to so concentrate
        a pencil-thin
        beam that it becomes
        hotter than the surface
        of the sun.

        Laboratory LASERS have
        punched holes in stainless
        steel. Last week one
        slashed through a diamond---the
        hardest substance
        on earth.

        ## Enormous

        Present LASERS are only
        the size of flashlights.
        If they could be built to
        the size of big guns and
        supplied with enough
        power, the possibilities
        are enormous.

        Secret Service reports say
        the Russians are working
        hard on LASERS
        and that Krushchev
        was referring to them
        when he made his boast
        of "fantastic weapons"
        to come.

        In view of the new blueprint
        for a future war,
        it is considered significant
        here that the Air
        Force has clamped tight
        security on all its satellite
        test shots.

        No details, no results are
        to be announced.

        It is also significant that
        the Air Force is engaged
        in a tussle with
        the National Space
        Administration over
        which should have
        priority: scientific or
        military satellites.

        And the Air Force seems
        to be winning.

        SIR BERNARD LOVELL forecasts that in 1962 instruments
        will be landed on the moon, probably by both
        the Russians and the
        Americans.

        A year ago, Professor Lovell,
        the director of the radio-astronomy
        station at Jodrell
        Bank, predicted that man
        would go into space in 1961. He
        was right.

        In an interview he forecast a
        coming year of increasing space
        activity, despite the secrecy
        shrouding Russian intentions.

        "A year ago I predicted that
        a man would go into space in
        1961. I predict with the same
        amount of confidence that 1962
        will be a year when instruments
        will be landed on the moon's
        surface, probably by both the
        Russians and Americans and
        this will be a very exciting step
        forward.

        ## EYES

        ## On Russia

        "There will be something
        fairly big happening before
        long. Either a man going round
        the moon and back or an animal
        encircling the moon."

        Space probes of the future
        were expected to operate on
        higher frequencies, calling for
        a greater degree of accuracy
        from tracking stations.

        He was anxiously awaiting
        another display of Russian
        technique to get an idea of the
        rate at which the Russians
        were changing over to higher
        frequencies. But any probe
        launched now by the Russians
        on a high frequency would be
        quite helpless.

        # Mars Is Not Red, Says A Russian

        By ROBERT CHAPMAN

        MARS, the Red Planet, may
        not be red after all, says
        a new report from Russia's
        Pulkovo Observatory.

        The report, which challenges
        fundamental beliefs about the
        planet, is based on observations
        made by Dr Nikolai Kozyrev,
        one of the Soviet Union's leading
        astronomers.

        Mars, it says, may not be the
        lifeless world that generations
        of scientists have thought: on
        the contrary, it may be very
        much like our own world with
        lush vegetation and animal life.

        The ruby glow of Mars in
        the night sky has long been
        interpreted as sunlight reflected
        from a barren, orange-red,
        sandy surface.

        Dr Kozyrev says the redness
        is due to the absorption of blue
        and violet light rays in the
        atmosphere---creating a red sky
        similar to that often seen at
        sunset on Earth.

        WASHINGTON, Sunday.

        AMERICAN astronauts will
        get extra "danger money"
        if present plans go through.
        They are entitled now to no
        more than their normal pay as
        military test pilots.

        The object is twofold: To compensate
        them for the special
        hazards of their profession and to
        lessen any temptation to accept
        embarrassing gifts or favours.

        ## £178,000 CONTRACT

        It is no secret that the Kennedy
        Administration is unhappy about
        the £178,000 contract the astronauts
        signed collectively with
        Life magazine during the Eisenhower
        years for exclusive rights to
        their "personal" space fight
        stories.

        The men are investing some of
        their capital in a luxurious motel
        nearing completion at Cape
        Canaveral. National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration officials,
        anxious to avoid public criticism,
        have reported to have laid down a
        strict policy amounting to an
        official boycott of the motel.

        # ATLAS TESTING TOO RISKY

        From Our Own Correspondent

        WASHINGTON, Sunday.

        There will definitely not be a
        full-scale test of an Atlas missile
        with a nuclear warhead during the
        current American test series in the
        Pacific, the technical journal
        Missiles and Rockets reported
        to-day.

        "The administration feels that
        the 3,000-mile flight of the Atlas
        would involve too great a risk," the
        magazine said. A Defence Department
        spokesman said he could
        neither deny nor confirm the
        report.

        LIVE television programmes
        beamed
        from America will be
        screened DAILY in
        Britain this summer.

        The programmes,
        "bounced" off a 125lb. TV
        satellite 3,000 miles up
        which the American Telephone
        and Telegraph
        Company plan to put into
        orbit by May, will be carried
        by BBC and ITV.

        A new Post Office receiving
        station is now being
        built in Cornwall. It
        will be Europe's first Space
        receiver and will pick up
        the TV sputnik's signals.

        This week top men of
        Europe's TV networks
        have been in London
        working out how to relay
        America's Space TV to
        the rest of Europe.

        ## Many

        They also plan to send
        live programmes from
        Europe to America.

        For a start, each programme
        will last about
        ten minutes---the length
        of time that the satellite
        will be in orbit at the
        required distance of 3,000
        miles above the Atlantic.

        But as it will circle the
        earth several times a
        day, many more programmes
        will be possible.

        The first sputnik---called
        Telstar---will go up in
        May. It will cost
        £2,000,000 to launch, and
        America's A T and T Company
        is bearing the whole
        cost.

        In the autumn the
        American Government
        will launch another---to be
        called Relay.

        ITV and BBC experts
        will work together. Associated
        TeleVision has already
        set up a team of ten
        engineers and technicians.

        ATV will have a crew
        in Cornwall to pick up the
        sputnik's signal from the
        Post Office receiver at the
        Lizard, feed it into the
        network and convert
        it into the European line
        standard for sending
        across the Channel.

        An ITV spokesman
        told me last night: "We
        don't know what kind of
        programmes the Americans
        will send. On our
        side, we plan to have
        outside broadcast units at
        various historic places in
        London, such as Buckingham
        Palace, Piccadilly
        Circus and so on."

        * But all this is only a
        beginning. If Telstar
        is followed by other sputniks,
        then round-the-clock
        live TV between Europe
        and America will become
        a reality. It's an exciting
        thought.

        # AF Lofts 38th 'Discoverer'

        VANDENBERG AIR FORCE
        BASE, Calif. (AP)---Discoverer 38
        rocketed into orbit on a secret
        mission.

        The Air Force did not disclose
        the satellite's altitude nor the
        length of time it takes to whirl
        around the earth from pole to
        pole.

        The Thor-Agena-B combination
        usually reaches an orbit ranging
        from 100 to 500 miles high and
        completes a full swing in about 90
        minutes.

        Sometime in the next four days
        the rocket's orbital second stage
        is supposed to eject a capsule
        which Hawaii-based planes will try
        to catch in the air.

        The chimpanzee named
        "Enos," which orbited the
        earth in a U.S. satellite last
        November has good grounds for
        being mixed up---and for hating
        buttons.

        Enos was trained to perform
        certain duties during the flight,
        including pushing buttons.

        If he did it right he was
        rewarded with food and drink.
        If he did it wrong he got a
        slight electric shock.

        Now it is revealed that
        throughout the actual flight,
        because of a short circuit, Enos
        was receiving a shock each time
        he pressed a button, whether he
        was right or wrong.

        "But," U.S. scientists now
        report, despite high blood pressure,
        the chimpanzee "continued
        to perform tasks for
        which he had been trained."

        The development programme of the
        Skybolt ballistic missile, for the
        bombers of the United States Air
        Force and the Royal Air Force, is
        being speeded up. More money has
        been put into it by the Department of
        Defence in Washington. This will
        allow for an expanded test programme
        and an early start on the production of
        components.

        There is also evidence of a reduction
        in range from the 1,000 nautical miles
        for which the missile was originally
        designed, and some relaxation in the
        precision sought. Britain is developing
        the use of the Skybolt in the Mark 2
        Vulcan bombers, which are due to be
        equipped with their first Skybolts early
        in 1965.

        ## Modifications

        It now appears that Britain will be
        paying about 15 per cent of the total
        cost of the programme, up to the time
        of production. Slightly more than £30
        millions has been set aside for the
        modifications to the Vulcan
        navigational system.

        Planned expenditure in the US has
        now risen to $450 millions or £170
        millions. At the development stage,
        almost all the British expenditure will
        be in sterling.

        The rise in the estimated cost of
        Skybolt has been described by Professor
        Courtland Perkins, the former
        assistant secretary of the US Air
        Force for Research and Development
        as "the most spectacular example of
        stretch." The Douglas Company,
        according to Professor Perkins, originally
        said that the research into the
        missile and its development would
        cost $120 millions. This figure has
        now been raised to $450 millions.

        In addition to the £30 millions now
        allocated, the RAF will pay for the
        missiles themselves (for the Vulcans)
        and for the nuclear warheads which
        must be produced for them. No estimate
        of the production cost of the
        weapon is yet available and under present
        accounting practices the cost of
        the warheads will not be published.

        The RAF is showing great confidence
        in the Vuclan-Skybolt combination and
        is now suggesting that there will be
        no need to replace it as the main
        British heavy nuclear force until 1972.
        Until recently, it had been assumed
        that another aircraft or a submarine
        rocket base was being considered for
        1970.

        THE first test firing of
        the Skybolt missile,
        launched from a giant
        B52 bomber over Cape
        Canaveral, was "one heck
        of a success," a United
        States Air Force official
        said yesterday.

        Skybolt, an Anglo-American
        missile due to become
        operational in 1964, will be
        supplied to the Royal Air
        Force for use with British
        Vulcan bombers.

        In the test the two-stage
        missile dipped after the
        first stage ignited---and
        then climbed steeply and
        disappeared from sight.

        The Air Force official
        said: "We don't know if
        the second stage ignited.
        But we consider it one
        heck of a success to gain
        so much on a maiden
        flight."

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (UPI)
        The United States will launch
        within a few days the first of a
        new series of satellites to find a
        way to forecast radiation "storms"
        that threaten manned flight
        through space.

        The 440-pound moonlet, called
        an "Orbiting Solar Observatory"
        (OSO), will be sent aloft aboard
        a three-stage Thor-Delta rocket,
        possibly as early as next Tuesday.

        OSO-1 will take the first direct,
        undistorted look at the sun to try
        to find out what makes it tick. The
        sun is the source of most of the
        high-intensity radiation that blows
        through space, making manned
        flights to the moon and planets a
        hazardous undertaking.

        The family of OSO satellites
        that the federal space agency
        plans to launch during the next 11
        years---a period covering one full
        "sunspot" cycle---probably will
        produce a method for predicting
        solar flares, scientists said.

        ## Would 'Fry' Travelers

        These flares are eruptions on
        the face of the sun. One expert
        said that on the average of one
        day out of 45, space travelers to
        the moon would be "fried" by such
        radiation, and that a journey to
        the moon during four or five other
        days during this period would be
        extremely dangerous.

        America's ambitious program for
        manned exploration of space calls
        for sending a team of three astronauts
        around the moon within the
        next five years, and to land three
        men on the moon shortly thereafter.
        However, occurrences of solar
        storms are expected to get
        steadily higher during the next
        few years, reaching a peak in
        1966--67.

        Scientists said the problem will
        have to be met by one of two
        solutions. Provide shielding averaging
        one ton per man for space
        travelers, or find some way for
        forecasting solar flares reliably.

        OSO-1, costing more than $6
        million to launch, will carry 13
        experiments to study radiation
        from the sun, the most intensive
        such research ever undertaken
        with the use of earth satellites.

        The moonlet will be hurled toward
        a nearly circular orbit more
        than 350 miles above earth. If all
        goes as planned, it will stay "alive"
        for six months and possibly a year,
        pouring out information on the
        workings of the sun that have
        baffled man for centuries.

        One key to success of the experiment
        will be the ability of
        scientists to line it up so it looks
        constantly at the sun. The moonlet
        will carry small nitrogen jets
        for this purpose. "The lifetime of
        these jets will determine the lifetime
        of OSO itself," the space
        agency said.

        The satellite also will carry a
        tape recorder to "memorize" information
        through 90 minutes of
        the 95 minutes it is expected to
        take OSO to orbit the globe once.
        During the remaining five minutes,
        technicians at ground tracking
        stations will play back the
        recording by remote control.

        # U.S.-Owned Space Network Urged

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---Sens.
        Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn. and
        Wayne Morse, D-Ore., here proposed
        legislation calling for a government-owned
        space satellite communications
        network.

        Their proposal renewed the fight
        over public vs. private ownership
        of utilities. President Kennedy already
        has asked Congress to create
        a privately owned corporation to
        operate the space communications
        system.

        The Senate space committee will
        open hearings on the Administration
        measure and a bill by Sen.
        Robert S. Kerr, D-Okla., which also
        would set up a privately owned
        corporation.

        # Space Test In a Spin

        CHICAGO (UPI) --- Naval researchers,
        working on the problem
        of how to put man into space, reported
        that six men adjusted rapidly
        to a room that rotated in the
        manner of a satellite at launching.

        Dr. Ashton Graybiel, director of
        the U.S. Naval School of Aviation
        Medicine at Pensacola, Fla., and
        the medical officer in charge of
        the Able-Baker monkey flight, conducted
        the experiment. It was described
        in the July Archives of
        Neurology, published by the American
        Medical Association.

        The report said four voluntees
        at a time were locked inside a
        circular room for two days while
        it was rotated at velocities from
        1.71 to 10 revolutions per minute.

        Most of the volunteers initially
        developed discomfort: apathy, visual
        illusions and nausea, but all
        these symptoms decreased or disappeared
        rapidly, the report said.

        Graybiel said he hoped his findings
        would be useful in selection,
        indoctrination and preconditioning
        of personnel for space flight. He
        said they also held  promise of furthering
        the study of the etiology
        and control of motion sickness.

        THE Russians may
        have decided to play
        the Americans at their
        own game and go into
        the "sky spy" business.

        A new Sputnik,
        launched by the
        Russians last week-end,
        could have TV cameras
        aboard, similar to those
        with which they photographed
        the far side
        of the Moon.

        They are being unusually
        secretive about the new
        satellite---their fourteenth.

        Very little has been heard
        of what it is supposed to do---and
        nothing at all about
        how it is faring.

        British scientists have
        picked up signals from the
        new Sputnik. But without
        knowing the precise code,
        the signals are meaningless.

        Even so, the scientists
        can get some idea of what
        is going on. They say the
        amount of information
        being sent back to Russia
        from the Sputnik is much
        more complex than
        hitherto.

        ## Daily

        At the Pentagon, the
        United States defence
        headquarters near WashIngton,
        the idea that the
        new Sputnik could be a
        "sky spy" is being given
        careful thought.

        The Pentagon has little
        to say on the subject---even
        though the new Sputnik is
        daily crossing vast areas of
        American territory.

        My colleague Donald
        Ludlow, in Washington,
        told me yesterday: "No
        one will say even how
        many times it has passed
        over, or how much territory
        it could have mapped."

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)---The
        United States plans next week
        to launch the world's first orbiting
        solar observatory to probe basic
        mysteries of the sun and how its
        rays affect the earth.

        The satellite, nicknamed Oso,
        may provide man with his first
        undistorted study of the sun.

        The aim is to send Oso whirling
        in an orbit 350 miles above the
        earth. At that altitude the instruments
        aboard will make solar
        studies uncluttered by the blanketing
        veil of the earth's atmosphere.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration (NASA) reported
        the 440-pound satellite is
        the first of several such observatories
        planned during the next few
        years.

        Eruptions of flares on the sun
        occur in 11-year cycles, each cycle
        ranges from maximum to minimum
        activity, and then a new one starts.
        Scientists say we are at present
        about at the midpoint of one of the
        periods. NASA hopes to chart the
        rest of this cycle at least half
        of the next one.

        The space agency said a procession
        of Oso satellites could help
        answer such questions as how the
        sun controls the upper atmosphere,
        the origin and history of the solar
        system and the structure and evolution
        of the stars and galaxies.

        The answers could lead to better
        explanation of how the sun determines
        the earth's weather, upsets
        radio communications an changes
        the composition of the radiation
        belts girdling the globe.

        The earth's atmosphere protects
        people from most of the lethal radiation
        streaming from the sun by
        absorbing or distorting the rays---such
        as gamma rays, X-rays,
        ultraviolet and infrared.

        Oso carries 13 scientific instruments
        to measure these particles as
        they fly through space. From the
        measurements, NASA said, "the
        abundance of the elements in the
        sun, the sun's composition and the
        intensity of its radiations can be
        studied."

        By RONALD BEDFORD, Mirror Science Editor

        AMERICA announced yesterday that
        she is to repeat an experiment which
        angered world scientists when it was
        tried last October---sowing a crop of
        250,000,000 hair-thin copper wires in
        Space.

        The idea is that the needles should settle 2,000
        miles above the earth, forming a sort of floating
        carpet.

        By bouncing radio signals off the under-side of the
        carpet, American scientists claim that they can provide
        a communication system
        for:

        1) Their rapidly-growing
        fleet of atomic submarines,
        which can fire
        Polaris H-rockets while
        still submerged, and

        2) Their vast fleet of
        Strategic Air Command
        H-bombers, scores of
        which are always in the
        air ready to devastate
        Russia in the event of a
        surprise attack.

        ## Protests

        The October experiment
        failed because the needles
        clustered together in five
        or six small clumps.

        It drew violent protests
        from Russian and British
        scientists, who complained
        that a carpet of needles
        might hamper astronomical
        research or imperil Space
        craft.

        Professor Fred Hoyle, of
        Cambridge University,
        branded it as "a major
        intellectual crime."

        A DEAD Russian astronaut may be orbiting the
        earth in a Space-ship launched two years ago,
        according to a senior American Air Force officer.

        The officer is Colonel Barney Oldfield, chief Press officer of
        the North American Defence Command.

        He suggested at Fort Worth, Texas, that the booster unit
        of the Russian Space-ship falled to separate.

        "If this is so," said Colonel Oldfield, "it is a 'first' to which
        the Russians are welcome---the first
        cosmic coffin in a celestial cemetery."

        He was disclosing for the first time
        information which, he said,
        had been gleaned by
        American U2 spy planes.

        ## Exploded

        Colonel Oldfield said that
        photographs showed rockets
        on Russian launching pads.
        Later the rockets had gone,
        and there was only
        scorched earth in their
        places.

        "We know the Russians
        did not put anything into
        orbit from these spots," he
        said. "Whatever was there
        must have exploded on the
        pad."

        AMERICAN rocket scientists sent a
        monkey into Space yesterday,
        brought it back to earth . . . and lost it
        in the Atlantic Ocean.

        Yesterday's Space traveller, a 4lb. monkey
        called Scatback, was launched---in a 6ft. capsule
        aboard a 100-ton Atlas rocket---at Cape Canaveral,
        Florida.

        Scatback went 6,000
        miles, in a huge arc which
        took him 600 miles above
        the earth and brought him
        down somewhere in the
        South Atlantic.

        The capsule carried a
        radio beacon to help
        searchers to find it. But
        the beacon failed.

        Rough seas made the
        hunt even harder. And
        two planes helping the
        search had to give up
        when fuel ran low.

        Late night Scatback
        was still missing.

        # Solid-Propellant Rockets Won't Drop Burned Booster

        Two-stage rockets now being built as
        antiaircraft missiles will not drop the first
        stage after it has burned out. In the past
        the burned-out booster stage was jettisoned
        to reduce weight. But the process
        also required complicated separation instruments and a joint between the stages.
        More efficient solid fuels will reduce the
        over-all size and weight of the missile and
        overcome the dead-weight problem of carrying
        the booster for the remainder of the
        flight.

        AMERICAN plans to hurl
        bigger and better
        Spaceships to the Moon
        and the planets suffered a
        severe setback last night.

        A new rocket, called Centaur,
        using a new fuel, exploded
        fifty-five seconds
        after liftoff from the new
        Pad 36 at Cape Canaveral.

        The 135-ton Centaur rocket
        was designed to put a
        one-ton robot on the Moon,
        or send half-ton robot
        Spaceships to Mars a
        Venus later this year.

        The new fuel, liquid hydrogen,
        was in the rocket's
        second stage. Scientists
        hoped that it would provide
        two-fifths more "kick"
        per pound per second than
        existing fuels.

        The 105ft rocket lifted
        off cleanly but exploded in
        a huge mushroom of bolling
        flame several thousand
        feet up.

        EIGHTY scientists and administrators meet in
        London today to spend the next three weeks
        trying to get the Commonwealth into orbit.

        Their big task: to decide how best to move
        into the Space communications business while
        keeping existing methods of long-distance communication---by
        cable and radio---up to date.

        In addition to Britain, countries taking part in the
        talks, which will be mostly In private, include Australia,
        Canada, Ceylon, Ghana, India, New Zealand, Nigeria,
        Pakistan, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,
        and Sierre Leone.

        The delegates have to
        decide how far ahead to
        go with the round-the-world
        telephone cable
        plan, costing £80,000,000,
        that is now in hand. Only
        the first section, linking
        Britain and Canada, is
        complete.

        ## Saved

        Most important question
        is: How much of this
        money could be saved
        to go towards the
        £200,000,000 Spacephone
        idea put before the
        Government by the British
        Space Development
        Corporation?

        The Spacephone plan
        calls for eight to ten satellites
        in orbit 7,480 miles
        up. By 1968 they could
        enable you to dial Australia,
        via Space, for 7s. 6d a
        minute.

        Delegates to the vital
        communications talks
        know that theirs is one
        meeting that really HAS
        to get off the launchpad.
        Time is not on the side of
        the planners.

        In a few weeks, the first
        of a series of advanced
        communications satellites
        will be blasted off from
        Cape Canaveral, in Florida.

        These satellites are designed
        to develop transatlantic
        communications
        networks and transatlantic
        TV from Space.

        Britain is joining the
        American experiments. A
        £500,000 communications
        satellite tracking station
        nearing completion at The
        Lizard, Cornwall, will
        track the cone-shaped US
        relay satellites, each
        weighing 85lb.

        * Any tendency on the
        part of British delegates
        at the London conference
        to adopt a go-slow
        policy on economy
        grounds will, I forecast,
        result in some very sharp
        prodding from the younger
        Commonwealth countries.

        PRESIDENT KENNEDY
        today revealed to Congress
        details of his plan to
        sell a chunk of Space to
        private enterprise.

        He wants to form a
        [...] corporation. Shares
        in it will be sold to the
        public and to communications
        firms in America
        and abroad. It will launch
        satellites for a world-wide
        statem of television, radio
        and telephones. And to
        prevent domination of the
        corporation by any single
        stockholder, no investor
        will be able to own more
        than fifteen per cent. of
        the total share issue.
        Total foreign ownership
        can amount to one-fifth.

        Kennedy's idea is that
        more than one billion
        dollars---about £350,000,000---of
        voting stock should
        be offered to the public
        and communications companies
        at not less than a
        thousand dollars a share.

        Launchings would be
        handled by the Government
        but the new corporation
        would pay for the
        rockets, satellites and so
        on.

        Profits---small at first
        but huge eventually---would
        be made from leasing
        satellite channels to
        firms and organisations
        all over the world.

        The scheme is already
        causing misgivings here.
        Even in profit-conscious
        America people are uneasy
        about handing over such a
        project to private firms.

        * I think that this is a
        case where the US
        Government should remain
        solely in control.

        THE United States Air Force has asked American aircraft,
        electronic and equipment manufacturers to submit
        proposals for a new type of ballistic missile with an outstanding
        performance. The fact that the weapon is also intended
        to be suitable for NATO
        forces suggests that a sales
        drive will be promoted to
        obtain acceptance by NATO
        countries generally.

        This is of considerable significance
        because it indicates the
        possibility of a change in the
        United States policy of discouraging
        independent control
        of nuclear warheads by NATO
        countries.

        Mr. McNamara, American Defence
        Secretary, is reported to have
        said the weapon would be "much
        more accurate and much cheaper"
        than the Polaris missile fired from
        submarines and already in service
        in the United States Navy. In fact,
        the new missile would be the land-based
        complement of the Polaris.

        The weapon comes within what
        is known as the mobile medium
        range ballistic missile category. It
        is to have a range of between 2,000
        and 3,000 miles. A main feature
        is that it will be capable of being
        transported on lorries and of being
        fired within a short time after
        arrival at any position.

        ## SIMPLER SYSTEM

        ## Two-stage rocket

        This is expected to be made possible
        by a guidance system called
        "stellar-inertial." The relative position
        of stars and the movement and
        changes of direction of the missile
        would be used to set it on its correct
        trajectory after it has left the
        ground.

        This would eliminate the need of
        the precise launching position being
        set in the guidance system before
        the missile is fired. The first technical
        details of the weapon also
        suggest that it will be powered by
        a two-stage rocket and will be about
        20ft long.

        The United States Air Force's
        request for firms to study such a
        weapon is, however, three months
        later than expected. At this early
        stage there appears to be some uncertainty
        about its feasibility and
        future.

        Dr. H. Brown, director of
        Defence Research and Engineering
        at the Defence Department, has
        said that the department has
        reservations about the technical
        aspects. The extent to which there
        is a real military requirement for
        the missile and whether it is more
        of political significance has been
        questioned.

        Two firms are already studying
        the guidance system on contracts
        under the advanced technology
        programme. The United States Air
        Force has asked for £36 million for
        1963 for development.

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---Two top
        civilian space agency scientists said
        the Pentagon's "go-slow" approach
        on a program to map the earth
        with satellites could hurt America's
        chances of placing a man on the
        moon before 1970.

        The criticism of the Defense Department
        came during a House
        Space Committee's investigation of
        the Project Anna winking satellite.
        Dr. Harold Brown, director of defense
        research and engineering,
        told the subcommittee he was opposed
        to beginning work on a full
        scale Anna program until the results
        of the first mapping satellite
        had been evaluated.

        The United States failed in an
        effort to launch the first Anna satellite
        last week. A second attempt
        is scheduled later in the year.

        Homer E. Newell and John D.
        Nicolaides, both top officials in the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration's office of space
        sciences, agreed that Brown's position
        "could slow down" the timetable
        of the manned lunar landing.

        ## Center of Gravity

        The winking satellite, in addition
        to giving geographers more accurate
        maps, will also tell scientists
        the location of the earth's center of
        gravity.

        Subcommittee Chairman Joseph
        E. Karth, D-Minn., after hearing
        the testimony, urged NASA to develop
        a proper mapping program
        "inasmuch as it has rather great
        significance for the successful completion
        of the manned lunar programs."

        Newell said the United States
        must learn a great deal more about
        gravitation before it goes ahead
        with plans to rendezvous spaceships
        in orbit around the earth.

        NASA has indicated the rendezvous
        method may be used to send
        astronauts to the moon rather than
        a direct assault from the earth.

        Nicolaides said the United States
        should immediately begin plans to
        launch six winking satellites in different
        orbits around the earth. He
        said such a program would cost between
        $15 and $20 million a year
        for four or five years.

        CAPE CANAVERAL,
        Wednesday.

        UNITED STATES space
        scientists to-day created
        a synthetic thunderstorm in
        outer space. An electrical
        discharge took place when 95
        tons of water were freed from
        a Saturn rocket 65 miles out in
        space.

        This was the second successful
        firing of a 162ft Saturn, the world's
        largest known rocket. After it Dr.
        Werner von Braun, head of the
        Saturn development team, said the
        test augured well for the first
        manned flight aboard a Saturn-launched
        Apollo, expected late in
        1964.

        To-day's test involved the first or
        booster stage, a cluster of eight
        engines producing a total of
        1,300,000lb of thrust. The upper
        two stages have not yet been developed,
        so they were simulated with
        dummies containing 95 tons of
        water ballast.

        ## CLOUD OF ICE

        This water ballast was released
        to observe the effect upon the
        ionosphere. The first and second
        stages were destroyed by explosive
        charges, and the resulting cloud of
        ice flakes, eight to 10 miles across,
        looked to watchers on the ground
        like a white parachute.

        Spotter planes, including a Royal
        Air Force Comet from Patrick Air
        Force Base, noted a small flash of
        lightning, which was also detected
        by ground radar and radio. Dr.
        Stuhlinger, one of the Saturn team
        scientists, said the amount of electricity
        involved was as large as that
        found in natural thunderstorms.

        ## LAUNCHING TO-DAY

        The ice particles, whose movement
        created the electricity, dispersed
        at a speed of 1½ miles per
        second, nearly twice the speed of
        the rocket and much faster than
        expected.

        Meanwhile the countdown
        started early to-day for to-morrow's
        planned launching of the Anglo-American
        satellite S-51, postponed
        for a fortnight because of a technical
        fault in the launching rocket.
        The weathers is good and the
        launching should occur some time
        after 7 p.m., British time.

        AMERICA'S "sky spy" policy is
        branded today as being
        "brinkmanship in Space."

        This view, put forward by Britain's
        top aviation and Space
        journal, Flight, is bound to raise
        tempers and blood-pressure in the
        Pentagon, America's defence headquarters.

        The Flight argument is this. The
        United States, it says, pleads through
        Mr. Adlai Stevenson, at the United
        Nations for open-handedness in Space
        research, with all nations
        giving all the facts about
        the satellites they launch,
        and the results they get
        from them.

        Yet at the same time,
        the United States Air
        Force regularly blasts
        "Peeping Tom" satellites
        into orbits that take them
        over the whole of the
        Soviet Union.

        ## Six

        And America gives little,
        if any, information about
        how high they go, or what
        they do.

        Since November 22 last
        year six of these "Space
        spies" have been
        launched.

        In each case, basic facts
        about them have been
        held back. Says Flight:
        "The lesson of the U-2 it
        seems, has not been
        learned."

        The journal says
        America's secrecy is of
        doubtful military value,
        because the satellites can
        be observed from the
        Soviet Union.

        "And this secrecy represents
        a double standard,
        which is not tenable.

        "For world science and
        world politics the American
        attitude is dangerous.

        ## 'Blasted'

        "The 1960 Summit
        meeting preparations were
        blasted by the ill-timing
        of the U-2 affair. Now, a
        satellite carrying observation
        equipment is launched
        on the day following Mr.
        Krushchev's suggestion of
        co-operation in Space.

        "This is not what Mr.
        Stevenson calls 'good international
        conduct.' This
        is brinkmanship in
        Space."

        The United States cannot
        expect the Russians
        to hand over all their
        Space secrets while the
        Americans themselves
        parcel out some and pop
        others in the top-secret
        drawer.

        * Where they make a
        mistake is to shout
        loud for open-handedness
        and, at the same time,
        practise an underhanded
        policy. They can't have
        it both ways.

        # CRYING OUT FOR THE MOON

        THE next time you want a
        sum like £1,000 for some
        project in which you are
        particularly concerned, spare a
        thought for the chief accountant
        of America's Apollo plans.

        He will be spending £2,200m.
        in the next two years alone on the
        one project. By the end of the
        decade he will have spent, even
        at present estimates, between
        £7,000m. and £11,000m. on
        Apollo.

        Admittedly, Project Apollo is
        fairly grandiose, in that it entails
        putting three Americans on the
        moon and getting them back alive.

        Even so, the amount to be
        spent is a colossal sum by any
        reckoning. I always find it difficult
        reckoning in millions, for the
        sum is too big to add up to anything
        I can comprehend.

        So let it be compared with the
        annual budgets of some items of
        British science.

        In next accounting year
        Apollo will spend £1,100m. During
        the same time the United Kingdom
        Atomic Energy Authority will consume,
        on peaceful ideas, £68m.;
        the entire Department of Scientific
        and Industrial Research will get
        through £18m.; the Agricultural
        Research Council £6.5m.: the
        Medical Research Council £5.8m.;
        the Nature Conservancy £590,000;
        and the British space programme
        in all its aspects £500,000.

        ## Thinking Big

        These are the six departments
        coming under the Minister for
        Science. They represent almost the
        entire British scientific effort that
        is not tied to the universities, the
        Ministry of Defence, and the benevolent
        foundations. The total of
        their annual budgets for the forthcoming
        year is almost exactly
        £100m.---but only a tenth of what
        Apollo will get in the same time.

        Naturally, there has been a lot
        of talk recently in the United
        States about who will get how
        much of what contract. So far,
        North American Aviation is leading
        with a main contract of some
        £1,500m. This is a considerable
        sum for any firm, even one doing
        the amount of business that North
        American does, though it won't all
        come their way for quite a proportion
        of the work has to be subcontracted.

        Americans are always telling
        themselves to "think big." They
        have certainly done so with Apollo.
        Yet the sum is no bigger than
        might be imagined when the immensity
        of the task is considered.

        For the first time men will land
        somewhere else in the universe,
        probably by 1968. No wonder the
        cost is so great. Put that sum
        another way round and it represents
        £10 a day for 3m. years.

        The American space plans are
        frequently criticised by those who
        think the Americans should spend
        the money on more earthbound
        problems, such as starving children.
        But these problems are big enough
        to dwarf even the huge Apollo
        budget.

        Assume that two-thirds of the
        world needs aid. That means over
        2,000m. people. That means only
        £5 each spread over the rest of the
        decade if Apollo were scrapped.

        No romance. . . . This order will be given to men and
        women who voyage through Space to colonise the planets,
        says a report published
        yesterday.

        Only couples willing
        to agree not to have
        children during the
        voyages, which may last
        many months, and during
        their stay on distant
        worlds, will be
        allowed to go.

        There will be room for
        women on Space ships to
        Mars, Venus and beyond,
        says the report, "Outer
        Space---the Prospects for
        Man and Society," published
        by the Institute for
        Strategic Studies.

        But there will be neither
        room nor facilities for
        babies to be born and cared
        for on the long voyages.

        ## Worries

        The report is being studied
        by seventy delegates
        from fifteen nations attending
        the International Space
        Conference organised by
        the institute at Brighton.

        The report knocks down
        the idea that Earth's overpopulation
        worries will be
        solved by sending men and
        women to other planets.

        Says the report:

        "If, as is likely, 75,000,000
        babies are born each year
        by the year 2000, it would
        need 500,000 Spaceships,
        each 150 people,
        to leave the Earth at the
        rate of one a minute to
        break even with the rate of
        increased population."

        I HAVE been talking
        to the man responsible
        for getting an
        American on to the
        Moon.

        He is Brainerd Holmes,
        42, a greying, round-faced
        man with a gentle voice
        but a tough reputation
        for getting things done.

        He perfected the ballistic
        missile early warning
        system---which will be
        complete next year when
        the station on Fylingdales
        Moor, Yorkshire, is ready.

        Holmes told me there
        will be more one-man
        orbital missions like John
        Clenn's until all seven
        astronauts have "orbital
        time."

        Then each astronaut
        will serve as captain for
        longer missions of days
        and weeks in Space
        aboard two-man Gemini
        Spaceships. The first of
        these will be tested next
        year.

        ## Hoping

        Will the present astronauts
        be too old for a
        Moon trip?

        Said Holmes: "Each
        man is hoping to be on
        the first Moon team."

        He went on: "A man
        who doesn't have
        all the physical endurance
        of youth may be
        able to go. It might be
        very worthwhile to get his
        additional experience and
        knowledge."

        Glenn himself is outstanding
        proof of the fact
        that Space adventure can
        begin at forty.

        ## Search

        But Holmes said the
        search would start soon
        for new talent to train as
        "Moon men" and crew
        the giant 40-ton Apollo
        three-man moonship
        which is at the moment on
        the drawing boards.

        One thing is definite.
        No one will be blasted to
        the Moon on a one-way
        trip---even if they volunteer
        for this.

        "That has been definitely
        ruled out," said
        Holmes. "The thought of
        expending a man at any
        stage is not a part of our
        programme."

        # Plane nets capsule in mid-air

        By RONALD BEDFORD
        Mirror Science Editor

        AMERICAN
        missile scientists
        yesterday began
        studying "Space
        spy" photographs
        of Soviet rocket
        bases.

        The Space spy is a
        Discoverer satellite with
        high-precision cameras
        aboard.

        It spent four days last
        week whirling over Russia's
        main military Installations.

        ## Vehicles

        And its cameras are so
        powerful that the photographs---provided
        there is
        no cloud---can show parked
        aircraft and vehicles from
        300 MILES UP.

        One thing United States
        scientists want to check is
        the possibility of another
        Soviet Space launching.
        Preparations for such a
        "shot" will show up on the
        photographs.

        The United States Air
        Force, in a brief statement
        issued in Washington, yesterday
        admitted that a
        transport plane snatched a
        package of Instruments---ejected
        from the satellite---in
        mid-air over the
        Pacific.

        The satellite was
        launched last Tuesday
        from the base at Vandenberg,
        California---on an
        orbit that took it repeatedly
        over Soviet territory.

        Then a radio signal,
        beamed to the Discoverer
        as it passed over Alaska,
        fired braking rockets in
        the satellite.

        The plane, waiting over
        the Pacific, scooped up the
        satellite's instrument capsule.

        It was caught in a
        giant "butterfly" net
        trailing behind the aircraft.
        For the Space spy---mission
        completed.

        The terse Air Force announcement
        shows that
        America is taking an increasingly
        tough line with
        Russia.

        For it follows President
        Kennedy's week-end warning
        that America intends
        to resume nuclear tests in
        the ATMOSPHERE unless
        the Russians agree to a
        test-ban treaty.

        ## Freed

        America has been flying
        spy satellites over Russia
        since the U-2 spy plane,
        piloted by Francis Gary
        Powers, came down over
        Soviet territory in 1960.

        Powers was released by
        the Russians last month
        after serving eighteen
        months of a ten-year jail
        term for spying.

        ## By WERNHER VON BRAUN

        HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (UPI)---The
        United States, working in cooperation
        with and on behalf of the
        other nations of the Western
        world, has one of the most important
        and exciting challenges in
        history --- the exploration of the
        universe.

        Few accomplishments have had
        such profound effect on the future
        of humanity as will the results of
        this immense and fascinating endeavor.

        Achievements in the exploration
        of space are directly linked to
        overall technological advancement,
        and in our age such advancement
        is indicative of the relative position
        of nations. We Americans have
        already felt the sting of being
        second in a race in which we
        should, and could, have been first.

        Any remaining doubts that we
        are really in a space race with the
        Soviet Union were dispelled by the
        decision last spring of President
        Kennedy to launch an ambitious
        program for manned lunar exploration.

        We have the capacity to be first
        to the moon, therefore, we must be
        first.

        Unmanned artificial satellites
        are being launched with increasing
        frequency to perform a wide
        variety of services for mankind.

        Our Tiros meteorological satellites
        have proven their worth by
        permitting meteorologists to predict
        more accurately the weather
        and detect disastrous storms. The
        military has developed warning
        and reconnaissance satellites to
        help us maintain our military
        posture.

        The first solar observatory was
        successfully launched last month.
        It is now reporting back to earth
        how the sun affects the weather
        and any threats it may pose for
        space travelers.

        But perhaps the most immediate
        and practical interest is the communications
        satellite which will
        help put the man in the street in
        closer touch with his fellow
        humans around the world.

        The suborbital flights of astronauts
        Alan Shepard and Virgil
        Grissom, and the more recent
        orbital flight of John Glenn, were
        carried out under Project Mercury.

        Project Mercury will be succeeded
        by the Gemini manned spacecraft
        project, which calls for the
        orbiting of a two-man spacecraft.
        Gemini will be used to test the "orbital
        rendezvous" technique, by
        which an orbital launch vehicle
        and a manned spacecraft will be
        joined while in earth orbit and
        "relaunched" toward the moon.

        Experience gained in this method
        of landing astronauts on the surface
        of the moon will be under
        Project Apollo. A three-man spacecraft,
        Apollo, will follow Gemini.
        It will effect circumlunar and lunar
        landing missions scheduled before
        the end of this decade.

        Following the first tentative
        steps into space with Project Apollo,
        man will pull on his seven-league
        boots and take giant strides
        across space to the nearer planets
        of the solar systems. For Mars,
        and perhaps Venus, direct surface
        landings should be possible this
        century if the state of the art of
        astronautics continues to advance
        rapidly.

        However, landings on frozen
        Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
        may never be feasible, limiting
        man to landings on their natural
        moons.

        What happens when we get in
        space? The environment will be
        hostile to man. He will be threatened
        by meteoroids, radiation,
        temperature extremes, lack of atmosphere
        and lack of pressure. But
        if he understands and obeys its
        laws, space will treat him well.

        True, this goal to explore the
        realms of space is an ambitious
        program. But to me, it is a natural
        thing to do---to find out just what
        is out there and how we can use
        our new-found knowledge to better
        our way of life.

        THE United
        States is thinking
        about getting
        into the second-hand
        rocket business.

        For one very
        good reason:
        Economy.

        So many missiles are
        now being hurled from
        the launch-pads at the
        three main space bases---Cape
        Canaveral,
        Florida, Wallops Island,
        Virginia, and Vandenberg,
        California---that
        Americans are beginning
        to count the cost.

        Many rockets have
        boosters that fall back
        into the sea.

        The possibility has
        now been considered of
        recovering the boosters,
        refurbishing the engines
        and using them again.

        As some of these
        boosters cost as much
        as £350,000 each, big
        money is at stake.

        Scientists at the Marshall
        Space Flight Centre, at
        Huntsville, Alabama---which
        proudly boasts that
        it is the rocket capital of
        the Universe---have been
        going into the technicalities
        of booster recovery
        from the sea.

        In a report now being
        studied by British Space
        scientists they say:

        "Dunking a rocket engine
        in salt water has about the
        same effect as dunking
        a doughnut in
        a cup of coffee---it
        doesn't hurt much,
        and it can still be
        used."

        ## TENTH

        The Marshall
        Centre scientists
        fished boosters out
        of the Atlantic,
        after firing from
        Cape Canaveral,
        checked them over,
        tested them, and
        came up with some
        arithmetic that has
        excited Space chiefs
        in Washington.

        "Engines can be
        refurbished and put
        into firing shape
        again for about one-tenth
        of the cost of
        a new engine," says
        scientist Rudy Barraza,
        in a report to
        Marshall Centre's
        top man---Dr. Wernher
        von Braun.

        ## HERO

        Bull-necked, fair-haired
        Dr. von
        Braun was the
        main man behind
        Hitler's V-2.

        He is now one of
        America's Space
        heroes, and a
        naturalised citizen.

        A single engine, given
        the second-hand treatment,
        "may be used for as many
        as three to five Space
        flights," says Dr. Barraza.

        To learn about the
        second-hand rocket business,
        Marshall scientists
        dropped a big rocket engine
        into the sea off Cape
        Canaveral.

        They sploshed it to and
        fro in the water many
        times before fishing it out
        and sending it back to
        Huntsville.

        It was stored there,
        deliberately, for a fortnight
        to let the salt soak in.

        Then it was taken to
        pieces, checked and reassembled.
        Only a few
        parts needed replacement.
        The engine was test-fired,
        and it worked well.

        ## COATED

        For the first test, the
        engine had been well-coated
        with special preservatives.
        So the scientists
        decided to repeat the test,
        using half the amount of
        preservative.

        Again, it was
        sploshed in the sea.
        Again it was dismantled,
        checked---and
        fired successfully.

        Finally the rocket
        engine was sent
        back to the Cape
        for a third time,
        plunked in the
        water without any
        preservative at all.

        Once more, it
        worked like a dream
        when it was test-fired.

        Says Dr. Barraza:
        "We are now working
        out ways of
        preventing engines
        from breaking up
        when they plunge
        into the ocean."

        ## 'CHUTE

        One way: a
        parachute system
        similar to that used
        to return Colonel
        John Glenn's
        Friendship Seven
        Spaceship to the
        ocean.

        This would be designed
        to keep the
        rocket in the water,
        without sinking too
        deep, long enough
        for it to be fished
        out by high-speed
        patrol boats.

        The National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration,
        which runs
        America's Space business,
        is spending £400,000,000 on
        research this year.

        And with the military
        rocket development programme
        going full blast,
        savings by using second-hand
        rockets are not to be
        dismissed lightly.

        # Moon rockets will use liquid fuel

        By our Science Correspondent

        IT has now been decided that
        the first manned expedition to
        the moon will be propelled by
        liquid-fuelled rockets, not solid-fuelled.

        This settlers---temporarily---one
        of the bitterest arguments that has
        plagued the American space programme.

        It was claimed by some that giant
        solid-fuelled rockets could be
        developed much faster, and would be
        cheaper and more reliable. Critics
        said that they would be heavier and
        less efficient and would mean an enormously
        heavy vehicle at take-off. And
        they emphasised that tricky technical
        problems might arise in large-scale
        solid rockets.

        An article in a recent issue of
        Science describes some of the peculiar
        problems which crop up. The most
        striking is the fact that the burning
        surface of a solid propellant can act
        as an amplifier of sound.

        What happens is that a pressure
        wave strikes the burning surface, and
        this may increase the rate at which
        the fuel burns. This releases more
        energy, which amplifies the pressure
        wave. The body of the rocket may
        form a resonating cavity in which a
        pressure wave continues to bounce
        back and forth, picking up energy
        from the burning fuel all the time.
        Eventually, the rocket may blow up.

        The author of the article, Dr. F. T.
        McClure, of Johns Hopkins University,
        says that a slight change in a
        well-tested rocket, modification of
        "some trivial internal component,"
        may make it explode when the button
        is pressed---because the acoustic properties
        have been changed. A variation
        of a few thousandths of an inch
        in the fit of the propellant to the
        combustion chamber wall can change
        these properties radically.

        The more potent the fuel, and the
        higher the pressures in the combustion
        chamber, the more severe these
        amplification effects are likely to be.
        Because these effects are so subtle and
        difficult to predict, it is very difficult
        to be confident in advance that a
        design for a large solid rocket will
        work in practice.

        This is clearly one reason why
        Space Agency officials have decided
        to proceed slowly and cautiously with
        the development of giant solid
        rockets, and make the first moon
        landings with liquid fuels.

        # WE LOSE SPACE TOWN BID

        By ANGUS MACPHERSON

        A BRITISH bid to make
        Farnborough the centre
        of a £15,000,000-a-year
        European space industry
        has been turned
        down by the Continent.

        The 12 European nations concerned
        have voted to set up a
        new space town at Delft,
        Holland.

        British scientists considered that
        Farnborough---where the
        Royal Aeronautical Establishment
        has been working on
        space problems for more than
        ten years---was an ideal centre
        for ESRO (European Space
        Research Organisation).

        American space firms are already
        planning to move into the new
        space town, with the hope of
        fat contracts for satellites or
        rockets to launch them.

        ESRO's programme calls for a
        £100,000,000 launch programme
        over the next eight years. It
        includes:

        First launch of a European satellite
        by a Blue Streak combine
        early in 1966.

        Eight deep-space probes towards
        the moon, and six artificial
        satellites to circuit the moon.

        Hundreds of high altitude sounding
        rockets, and at least 20
        grapefruit-size satellites.

        A picked team will decide what
        space probes are to be made,
        and who is to make them.

        It will charter rockets to launch
        the satellites---from France's
        booming rocket industry, from
        the British-sponsored Blue
        Streak club, or from America.

        The first director of the space
        town is expected to be Dr.
        Albert Lines, 47-year-old head
        of Farnborough's space group.

        ## Mystery man behind Soviet cosmonauts

        A figure of mystery lurks
        behind Russia's cosmonauts
        whenever they make a public
        appearance. His name is Lt.-Gen.
        Nikolai Kamanin.

        The first time he came to the
        notice of British Intelligence
        was when he was noticed with
        Yuri Gagarin during the 24-year-old
        spaceflier's London visit
        last year.

        He popped up again earlier
        this month---this time hovering
        behind Gherman Titov in
        Washington. When the Press
        attache at the Soviet Embassy
        there announced the name of
        those who would be on the
        platform at Titov's press
        conference, he included "Lieut.-General
        Kamanin."

        "Who is Lieut.-General
        Kamanin?" came a chorus of
        voices. "Oh," said the Russian,
        "He is just---Lieut.-General
        Kamanin."

        ## Power in State Security force

        Under pressure he added:
        "He is one of our oldest pilots
        and one of our oldest Heroes of
        the Soviet Union."

        I expected some frail, white-haired
        figure to totter in. Surprise,
        therefore, when the
        dapper, alert, not-a-day-over-45
        figure of Gagarin's watchdog
        appeared.

        Now I learn that Lt.-Gen.
        Kamanin is a power in the
        State Security force of the
        Soviet Ministry of the Interior.
        And, I should say, judging by
        the black look on his face when
        Titov gave a piece of really
        interesting information, almost
        certainly the man who trains the
        cosmonauts in their glib answers.

        # THE 'MARROW' PUZZLES SCIENTISTS

        Soviet scientists should not
        be surprised if their
        Western counterparts sometimes
        disbelieve them.

        Top is the picture first
        released by Moscow of the
        rocket which launched Russian
        spacemen Gagarin and
        Titov into space. Western
        scientists called it "The
        Marrow."

        Bottom is the picture of
        the rocket published recently
        in Titov's autobiography.

        Question is: Who blunted
        its end, and why?

The\nfellow who gets himself shot a little way off the Earth and goes round\nit a few times is a brave man, but he is not a Spaceman.\n\nHe is certainly a pioneer. It is because of him that there will be men on the\nMoon, probably on Mars, and very likely on Venus, too, and that there may be\nmanned satellites in orbit about the Earth.\n\nBut a little bit of our own solar backyard is not Space.\n\nSpace is a very big place. Journeys to even the nearest stars would take\nthousands of years\nby rocket ships as\nwe know them.\n\nProbably the rocket\nship's greatest contribution\nwill be to make\npossible an observatory\non the Moon where the\nfurther study of Space\nwill be unhampered by\nan atmosphere.\n\nWhat shall we be looking\nfor in Space?\n\nSir Bernard Lovell, and\nothers, have pointed out\nthat some of the planets\nin Space are probably very\nlike Earth.\n\nMany of them may therefore\nhave produced lifeforms\nmuch like ours, and\non numbers of these\nplanets evolution may\nparallel that on Earth.\n\n## SHOCK\n\nTHERE is a disconcerting\nimplication in this\nbusiness, for if, as Sir\nBernard maintains, there\nare great numbers of\nplanets very similar to our\nown, then there must be\nmillions that are not quite\nsimilar to our own.\n\nAnd, among them,\nplanets where things that\nare merely unlikely possibilities\nhere have actually\ntaken place.\n\nYou see where this\nleads? It means that on\nvarious planets all those\npossible-improbabilities\nthat I thought I had imagined\nin my books---the\ntriffids, the deep-sea monsters,\nthe dangerous\nchildren, the woman's\nworld, and the rest of them\nmay really exist.\n\nIt comes as a great\nshock to a writer of fiction,\nparticularly of my\nkind of fiction, to learn\non such authority that he\nmay have been mistakenly\nwriting facts all\nthe time.\n\nI am sometimes asked:\n\"Why do you write such\nfar-fetched stories?\"\n\nBut, of late, I\ndo seem to meet\nthe question less\nfrequently, and\nfind myself wondering\nwhether it is simply\ngoing out of fashion, or\nwhether in a world that is\ngrowing more \"far-fetched\"\nevery day it is\njust losing its meaning.\n\nIt seems to me that, in a\nworld that has changed,\nand is changing, so fast,\ncuriosity about some of the\nthings that might conceivably\nhappen is perfectly \nnatural.\n\nMoreover, the signs are\nthat we are drawing close\nto the opening of a new\nphase; one that is going to\naffect us more more intimately\nthan all the scientific discoveries\nof the past.\n\nThe spectacular progress\nof the last century and a\nhalf was conducted almost\nentirely by engineers to\nbegin with, and then by\nchemists and physicists.\n\nThey have given us a\nbetter standard of living,\nless drudgery, more interests.\n\nYet progress has had\nlittle effect upon us, ourselves.\n\nBut coming to the fore\nnow are the newer scientists,\nthe biologists, the\ngeneticists, the psychologists,\nthe sociologists, the\npathologists, and the rest\nwith new knowledge leading\nto discoveries which are\ngoing to change not simply\nthe way we live, but _us_.\n\nWhen I wrote\n\"The Midwich\nCuckoos\" (filmed\nas \"The Village of\nthe Damned\") a\nfew years ago, I centred it\nround a group of children\nwho could read one another's\nthoughts and combine\nthem to make a very\npowerful mind.\n\nIt seemed fanciful then\nbut in even a short time it\nhas begun to seem less so.\n\nOnly a few days ago\ncame the announcement\nthat the great Westinghouse\nCorporation in\nAmerica is conducting research\ninto direct mental\ncommunication.\n\nImportant companies do\nnot start such projects\nwithout some good reason\nto expect results.\n\nRecently announced was\na breakthrough in genetics\ncalled DNA, which appears\nto be the first step that\nmay lead to the control of\nheredity.\n\n## ANGELS\n\nIT could perhaps lead on\nto the day when your\ngranddaughter hands in\nher recipe for her baby:\n\n\"A boy, please. I'd like\nhim to have his father's\nnose, my colour eyes, his\nfather's brains, but with\nmore of my practical sense.\nA bit more of my drive\nadded to his father's\npatience. . . .\"\n\nAnd so on, so that the\nchances of Mummy's little\nangel actually being angelic\nwould be greatly improved.\n\nOn the other hand, there\nare a lot of people uninterested\nin angels. A\nforceful, ambitious couple\nmight well wish their offspring\nto have the combined\ndrive of both, and\nthe softer qualities left out.\n\nHe would probably get\nalong pretty well, but\nhow much damage would\nhe do to others on his\nway?\n\nSo, as the results of this\ndiscovery develop, there\nwill loom behind them a\nhuge two-part question:\nAre we going to endow\nchildren with ambition, or\nwith the human virtues?\n\nThere will be more\nstraightforward, but still\nimportant, questions, too:\nHow, for instance, if the\nparents are to have any say\nabout the sex of the child,\nis it to be arranged that\nthe numbers of boy babies\nand girl babies shall be\nkept roughly equal?\n\nRussian research into\ngeriatrics---that is, the\nnature of old age---is said\nto be starting to produce\ninteresting results.\n\nEven if there is no breakthrough\nthere, it is unlikely\nto be very long before\nsome advance is made.\n\nWhat will happen when\nthe average expectation of\nvigorous life can be raised\nto 100 years or more?\n\nI tried in a story called\n\"Trouble with Lichen\" to\nforesee some of the results\nwe could expect.\n\nI started with the idea\nthat everyone would welcome\nlonger life as a\nwonderful gift, but the\nmore I thought about it,\nthe more doubtful I became.\n\nI tried to imagine the\nfeelings of a man expecting\nto reach the top of\nhis business around fifty\nand retire at sixty-five.\n\nThen he discovers that\nhe must wait for his promotion\nuntil he is eighty,\nand go on to ninety-five\nbefore he retires.\n\nIt did not seem to me\nthat he would be entirely\nhappy about it.\n\nThink, too, of a whole\nyounger generation faced\nwith unemployment because\nall the jobs are held,\nand held on to, by men and\nwomen who will be only\nmiddle-aged at eighty or so.\n\nNevertheless, one day,\nperhaps not so far away,\nthe chance to live a longer\nlife will be there, and some\nwill want to accept it.\n\n## CHANGES\n\nTHAT is going to be one\nof the changes that\nreally will alter our lives,\nright down to family level.\n\nThe differences in age\nbetween the youngest and\nthe eldest child in a family\nwill be much greater.\n\nWhen discoveries of such\nimportance are made it is\nnot a question of whether\nwe like them, or whether\nwe put them to use or not,\nany more than it was with\nnuclear fission.\n\nOnce a discovery exists\nyou can't abolish it, or\nwish it out of existence.\n\nNor can you do\nanything to prevent\nit being\nmade, for it may\nbe made unintentionally,\nas the discovery of\nrayon was; or it may come\nfrom an unexpected direction,\nas DDT came out of\nthe dyestuffs industry.\n\nOnce it is made, you are\nstuck with it. You may\nsuppress it for a time, but\nthe only use you can make\nof that time is to decide\nhow best to handle it.\n\nOnce it is here, you\nhave to learn how to live\nwith it.\n\nThe direction of our own\ndestiny will soon be in a\nnew stage, but it is not an\nentirely new trend.\n\nIt began when we discovered\nthat diseases were\nnot just acts of God, and\nthat it was possible to\nkeep alive many a child\nthat unassisted nature\nwould have slain young.\n\nThe control of heredity\nwill mean the checking of\nhereditary diseases such as\nhaemophilia, the disappearance\nof inherited\nmalformations, the elimination\nof colour-blindness\nand some types of asthma,\nand so on---benefits which\nno one would contest.\n\nAlso, there are mental\nqualities which are every\nbit as undesirable as physical\ndefects.\n\nSurely it would be a\ncrime to allow a baby to\ninherit instability or criminal\ntendencies; and would\nit be fair to let it be just\nmediocre when it might be\nhighly intelligent?\n\nOnce we have\nthese powers we\nshall have to use\nthem. Where they\nwill lead us, and\nwhat kind of men and\nwomen they may cause our\ndescendants to be even four\ngenerations hence, no one\ncan foresee.\n\n_Homo sapiens_ has been\nhaving a longish pause: he\nhas made virtually no progress\nfor 20,000 years or so.\nEither he must go on, or\nfossilise.\n\nMight it not be that\ncontrol of heredity is the\nkey he has been waiting\nfor before he _could_ go on?\n\nThe idea of change in\nourselves is not welcome.\nNot many of us would object\nto become the ideal\nspecimen of what we are,\nbut our instinct is to resist\nthe idea of a change that\nwould take us beyond that.\n\nIn \"The Chrysalids\"\nand in \"The Midwich\nCuckoos\" I used the idea\nthat sooner or later _homo superior_\nis going to turn\nup, and the stories are\nmainly concerned with the\nkind of reception he is\nlikely to get when he does.\n\nIt is a basically simple\nreaction. People will fear\nhim because he has advantages\nover them, and they\nwill try to suppress him.\nIn both these tales I supposed\nthat the superior\nkind would appear suddenly,\nas new types have\noften done in nature.\n\nIt made the issue quite\nclear---the new kind had\nto be got rid of before it\nbecame strong enough to\ndefend itself.\n\nIf he comes through controlled\nheredity, however,\nthere is no enemy. There is\njust ourselves---ourselves\nwith little deficiencies remedied,\nlittle improvements\nmade here and there, and\nthen one or two more improvements\nadded.\n\nWe are healthier,\nstronger, more intelligent,\nlonger lived; perhaps we\nhave keener powers of perception\nso that we have begun\nto think a little differently,\nperhaps that has\nimproved our brains so\nthat our heads have to be\na little bigger to hold them\n"

        comfortably, and then just
        a little bigger still.

        And then, presently, who
        are we? Are we still ourselves
        or have we become
        a different sort of mankind?
        Who can tell---and
        where is anyone to say
        "Stop!"?

        We must not forget the
        factors of chance and
        accident. In a story called
        "Consider Her Ways" I
        supposed an experimentally
        cultured
        disease
        that got away
        and wiped out
        men 100 per
        cent., but women only 20
        per cent.

        Women were thus left to
        manage the world their
        own way, and proceeded to
        do so.

        This curious state of
        affairs was imagined for
        entertainment and
        satire, but however
        highly improbable it may
        be, it is not impossible.

        Moreover, if such a
        thing should come about,
        we could, even with our
        present skills, keep the race
        going by artificial insemination,
        so that it would,
        in time, recover.

        The idea of its continuation
        as an entirely female
        world is a bit more fancy---and
        yet, I wonder.

        If the kind of
        massed brainpower
        that was
        turned on to the
        production of the
        nuclear bomb were to be
        set to finding a means of
        parthenogenesis---that is,
        the ability to produce offspring
        without male assistance---I
        think I'd bet on
        success.

        So far, you will have
        noticed I have been
        assuming that The Bomb
        will be kept safely behind
        bars.

        If it is not, those of us
        who are left are not so
        likely to be concerned with
        improving our own
        heredity as with stopping
        the modifications of it
        from running wild.

        ## FREAKS

        IN "The Chrysalids" I
        imagined what the world
        might be like long after an
        atomic war.

        The centres of radioactivity
        were still unapproachable,
        but round
        them were belts of country
        where the radiation, while
        not deadly, was strong
        enough to affect the genes
        of inheritance in animals
        and plants.

        Little that lived there
        bred true to type.

        The chief concern of the
        surviving communities of
        normal mankind then became
        to keep the freaks at
        bay, and rid themselves of
        any variations from what
        they considered to be the
        true human form.

        They could not succeed,
        of course, any more than
        the present world population
        could succeed in keeping
        its various races distinct
        and pure.

        Little by little, changes
        would creep in.

        So there could, in a short
        time from now, exist two
        factors capable of stirring
        our evolution out of its
        20,000 year pause in its progress.

        One, violent and unpredictable,
        is here already.

        The other, gradual, but
        unable to see more than a
        step or two ahead, is yet to
        come.

        Nature is a much misused
        and sentimentalised
        word. Man is a product of
        nature. Therefore the
        ability to do all the things
        he does must lie in his
        nature, or he could not do
        them.

        Consequently, all the
        things he does do are works
        of nature for which he has
        merely been the means.

        Thus his discovery of
        agents which affect heredity
        could be the natural
        means of shaking him out
        of his pause, and setting
        his evolution on the move
        again.

        ## FEAR

        FOR my part, I do not
        think the active agent
        will be The Bomb---we fear
        it too much to use it on
        the scale necessary for it
        to be effective.

        There seems more probability
        that it will remain in
        the background as a
        stabilising factor---and be
        very valuable there.

        The invisible presence
        of an Omnipotence
        powerful enough to curb
        selfish ambitions is not---as
        the Children of
        Israel used to need
        reminding---necessarily a
        bad thing.

        But if we take the other
        way, and set out to steer
        our own destiny, where are
        we going to find the knowledge
        we shall need?

        How are we to know
        which is the road to disaster,
        and which is the true
        line we should take?

        THE ANSWER, IT NOW
        APPEARS, LIES IN
        SPACE.

        # 7,000-MILE ATLAS

        From Our Own Correspondent

        NEW YORK, Thursday,

        An Atlas missile was fired more
        than 7,000 miles to-day from Vandenberg
        Air force base, California, to a
        point 200 miles east of Mindanao, in
        the Philippine Islands. The United
        States Air Force announced the firing
        was a "routine training launch," and
        the missile had no warhead.

        # Deadlock on how to aid spacemen

        By JOHN DAVY
        Our Science Correspondent

        THE elaborate series of talks on international co-operation
        in space, now drawing to a close in Geneva, has produced
        some useful successes, and some melancholy failures.

        On the one hand, a multi-million
        dollar operation called
        the World Weather Watch has
        been conceived and seems likely
        to be successfully delivered by
        the United Nations in due
        course.

        On the other hand, the United
        States and Russia have so far
        failed to agree on the apparently
        simple humanitarian problem of
        aiding astronauts in distress.

        ## 'Spies' condemned

        The Russians have proposed---to
        the Legal Sub-Committee of the U.N.
        Committee on the Peaceful uses of
        Outer Space---an agreement for rescuing
        distressed astronauts and returning
        displaced spaceships to the
        owners. But it includes a provision
        that "space vehicles aboard which
        devices have been discovered for the
        collection of intelligence information
        in the territory of another State shall
        not be returned."

        They have also tabled some
        "general principles" including one
        which condemns the use of satellites
        "for the collection of intelligence information"
        as "incompatible with
        the objectives of mankind in its conquest
        of outer space."

        This irritates the Americans, who
        have an elaborate reconnaissance
        satellite programme which they do
        not propose to abandon. They tend to
        argue that spy satellites, by banishing
        secrecy, will bolster confidence and enhance
        the prospects of peace.

        They also claim that a valid distinction
        between scientific instruments
        and equipment for spying cannot
        easily be made. If a weather
        satellite photographs clouds over
        Tashkent, is it spying? If an
        astronaut films the earth from his
        capsule is he gathering intelligence
        information or not?

        ## Weather watch

        So far, the only matter on which
        the Legal Sub-Committee seems
        likely to agree is mutual liability and
        compensation for damages caused by
        space activities.

        At the same time, the World
        Meteorological Organisation has
        agreed to place before the U.N. a
        vast plan for a World Weather
        Watch, including the use of weather
        satellites and a global exchange of
        weather information. It also proposes
        a new network of terrestrial
        observatories, including 20 new
        permanent weather ships, estimated
        to cost some $35 million to install
        and $16 million a year to run.

        Two main centres---one in Washington
        and one in Moscow---would
        supervise and co-ordinate the watch,
        which would enable meteorologists
        to keep an eye on virtually all the
        weather all the time.

        ## Amicable wind-up

        This proposal has been bolstered
        by the bilateral discussions concluded
        a week ago between the U.S.
        and Russia, when Dr. Hugh Dryden
        of the U.S. Space Agency and
        Academician Blagonragov agreed to
        exchange weather satellite data and
        eventually, perhaps, to co-ordinate
        launchings.

        The Technical and Scientific Subcommittee
        also wound up amicably
        last week, having agreed to recommend
        the establishment of a U.N.-sponsored
        sounding-rocket launching
        site near the magnetic equator. The
        site is expected to be in Southern
        India, although Argentina is also
        making a claim.

        # Soaring soon---a Space cat . .

        By Ronald Bedford

        MEN, dogs, rats, rabbits
        and mice have all
        made Space-trips, and
        come back alive.

        Now it is the turn of the
        CAT.

        French scientists are getting
        ready to put one
        into the nose-cone of a
        research rocket.

        This autumn, if all goes
        well, a cat will blast
        away from the launchpad
        at the Hammaguir
        rocket base in the
        Sahara Desert for an
        up-and-down trip.

        ## Rat

        In February, 1961, a white
        rat called Hector, wearing
        a natty line in
        Space-suits, took a
        three-minute trip from
        Hammaguir.

        He went ninety-three
        miles above the Earth In
        the nose of a Veronique
        rocket, and landed by
        parachute.

        The Space-Cat attempt
        will give French scienlists
        more valuable data.

        # SATELLITE TO BE SPEEDED

        ## WOOMERA IN 1965

        From Our Own Correspondent
        SYDNEY, Thursday.

        Mr. Thorneycroft, Minister of
        Aviation, and the Federal Government,
        have completed talks in
        Canberra. They arranged to send
        up the European Launcher Development
        Organisation's first
        satellite at Woomera in 1965, a
        year earlier than planned.

        They decided also to extend for
        another three years the British-Australian
        agreement on Britain's
        weapon testing programme at
        Woomera.

        Mr. Thorneycroft said that
        Britain and Australia should develop
        the capacity to put a man
        into space, but he was not suggesting
        that one should be put into
        space from Woomera.

        # X15 Survives Intense Heat

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (UPI)---Maj Bob Rushworth
        piloted the X15 rocket ship
        through a scorching heat test
        and safely withstood a temperature
        of 1,250 degrees Fahrenheit that,
        unshielded, would burn a man to
        a crisp.

        The 37-year-old Air Force test
        pilot went faster than planned in
        the preflight schedule. He was
        shielded by the craft's ingeniously
        designed cockpit, armored with
        protective insulation and cooled
        with liquid oxygen. His pressurized
        flight suit of silver nylon also
        created its own "livable" atmosphere
        for him.

        The X15 scorched through the
        air at a top speed of 3,511 miles
        an hour---or more than three times
        the speed of sound---after it was
        launched from a B52 mother ship.
