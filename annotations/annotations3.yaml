        # FIRM'S £17m VENTURE

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        WASHINGTON, Tuesday.

        A THOR-DELTA rocket soared up from Cape Canaveral
        to-day in an almost perfect launching to put Telstar
        into orbit. Scientists of the American Telephone and
        Telegraph Company, owners of
        the satellite, were jubilant.

        They considered it well worth
        the £1 million the company is
        paying the Government Space
        Agency for use of the rocket and
        launching facilities, and the total
        of over £17 million already
        spent.

        Fore-runner of a satellite system
        that will make world-wide television
        possible, Telstar is circling
        the earth every 158 minutes. The
        178lb satellite is swinging between
        a low point 593 miles from the
        earth, and a distant point 3,502
        miles away.

        It was midnight, London time,
        before Telstar was in position for
        the first test transmissions between
        Andover, Maine, and Holmdel,
        New Jersey.

        The plan was for the tests to be
        picked up by the station on
        Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, and
        transmitted in Britain. Next week,
        if all goes well, television pictures
        relayed to Britain will go out on
        the Eurovision network too.

        ## FILMED TALK

        ## In sight on fifth orbit

        Company technicians were ready
        at Andover and Holmdel to-night
        to transmit and receive news pictures,
        telephone conversations and
        a film talk by Mr. Frederick
        Kappel, chairman of the company.
        The satellite would be "in sight"
        for only a few minutes on its fifth
        orbit.

        Telstar has nearly 15,000 parts
        inside its 34-inch diameter. It is
        designed to pick up signals that
        will be faint by the time they reach
        it, amplify them and retransmit
        them on another frequency.

        It will draw its power from the
        3,600 solar cells on its surface, that
        will convert the sun's light into
        electrical energy. At Andover,
        Maine, a 380-ton horn antenna will
        scoop up the weak signals from
        Telstar and convert them for television
        and telephone circuits.

        ## IMAGINATION CAUGHT

        ## Use for telephones

        The idea of an eventual satellite
        system that will enable Americans
        to watch the Trooping the Colour
        ceremony or the 1964 Olympic
        Games in Tokyo while they are
        taking place has caught the public
        imagination.

        But it is the possibilities for
        greater international telephone services
        that excite the American
        Telephone and Telegraph Company.
        This is why it has committed
        £17 million to the scheme
        already, and is prepared to spend
        more.

        It now operates 600 circuits for
        overseas telephone calls. By 1980,
        it estimates, 10,000 will be needed.

        It would take 50 underseas
        cables to handle the work, about
        100 million overseas telephone calls
        a year. The company believes a
        satellite system, using as many as
        50 or 60 Telstars, would carry most
        of the burden more efficiently.

        ## CONGRESS ROW

        ## Enormous expense

        Pointing to the enormous expense
        of creating such a system,
        the company insists this is no
        "get rich quick" investment.
        This has not forestalled a first-class
        row in Congress.

        A Bill now before the Senate
        would set up a Corporation to
        run it.

        Several objectors, protesting
        vehemently that the company
        would benefit unduly from scores
        of millions of pounds of tax
        money spent on space research,
        are threatening to talk the Bill to
        death.

        # SATELLITE IN POSITION FOR 15-30 MINUTES

        By L. MARSLAND GANDER,
        Daily Telegraph Television and Radio
        Correspondent

        POST OFFICE engineers
        waited at the £750,000
        Goonhilly Downs receiving
        station in Cornwall last night
        for the climax to years of
        scientific effort. The aerial was
        adjusted to receive radio
        whispers from the satellite 12
        and 15 hours after its
        launching.

        Telstar was in a position visible
        mutually to Goonhilly and the
        American ground station at
        Andover, Maine, only on the fifth
        and sixth orbit. No pictures were
        received during the fifth orbit
        between 9.30-10 p.m.

        During the two hours and 36
        minutes of the orbital time, the
        ideal position occurred for a period
        that would permit communication
        for, at the most, about 30 minutes
        and more probably 15 minutes.

        ## OPEN TO 1.30 A.M.

        ## Amplified 10,000m times

        The BBC obtained permission
        from the Postmaster-General last
        night to keep its television network
        open until 1.30 a.m. to put on home
        screens any transatlantic pictures
        received through Telstar.

        In the BBC's London studio
        Richard Dimbleby introduced a
        preliminary programme called
        "Project Telstar" and Raymond
        Baxter gave a commentary from
        Goonhilly Downs, where BBC
        cameras had been installed.

        Telstar was designed to receive
        a radio signal beamed at it from
        the ground and to amplify it 10,000
        million times, transmitting back to
        earth 600 telephone conversations
        or one television channel.

        ## ONLY CHANCE FOR DAYS

        ## Transmission plan

        The sixth pass offered the only
        chance of seeing transatlantic
        television pictures for several days.
        It was intended to transmit five
        minutes of live pictures, two minutes
        of pulses and bars to give engineering
        information and 10 minutes
        of Videotape.

        # Europe, U.S. Swap TV Tours via Telstar

        NEW YORK (UPI)---Americans and Europeans took an
        armchair tour of lands across the sea via the space magic
        of Telstar, the tiny satellite destined to make global television
        commonplace in the future. Europeans heard part of
        President Kennedy's news
        conference and Americans
        saw a cross section of European
        life in the formal inauguration
        of live transatlantic
        television.

        It was a team effort by scientists
        and the television industries
        of two continents. At least part of
        the program pierced the Iron Curtain.

        The United States beamed a
        proud panorama of America to 18
        European countries linked by the
        Eurovision network. It ranged
        from views of skyscrapers and the
        United Nations in New York to
        baseball in Chicago to Indians and
        buffaloes in the West to the Golden
        Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

        The signals were picked up by
        Britain's big bowl-shaped antenna
        at Goonhilly Downs in Cornwall
        and an American, horn-shaped antenna
        at Lannion, France, and
        channeled into the Eurovision network
        for an estimated 200 million
        viewers.

        Europeans got their first sight
        of a live TV broadcast of an
        American baseball game at the
        start of the 18-minute program.

        The baseball game in Chicago
        was beamed out because the program
        got under way nearly a
        minute ahead of its scheduled time,
        nearly a minute before the start of
        the President's news conference.

        After a few minutes of the
        President's news conference, viewers
        were taken to Stratford, Ont.,
        for a brief view of a rehearsal of
        "Macbeth" at the Shakespeare
        Theater.

        # TELSTAR CALL

        By FRANK TAYLOR and
        JOHN BULLOCH

        (Continued from P.1, Col. 4)

        a satellite were the same as the
        first words of any threepenny call
        between neighbours---"How are
        you?"

        ## TAPE-RECORDED

        ## Effect on psychology

        In New York, Taylor sat in a bare
        auditorium with a tape recorder
        keeping a record of this moment.

        "In the hall here is Dr. Joyce
        Brothers, a psychologist. She
        believes that Telstar will have the
        greatest psychological effect of any
        modern invention.

        "Two minutes ago Dr. Brothers
        asked me to consider what the
        effect would be if we could export
        to Britain direct the soap operas
        which take up so much of television
        time here. She believes this
        will have a big effect on the people
        of Britain."

        In London, we were able to send
        to America this morning's headlines.
        Thanks to Telstar, American
        evening paper readers will know
        that the Prime Minister "won
        over" many of the Tory backbench
        1922 Committee.

        From New York and from London,
        across 3,000 miles and up
        2,500 miles, we said good night.
        Just as in any telephone-box, there
        was another caller impatiently
        waiting to go on.

        # SATELLITE LINK PRACTICAL

        ## TELSTAR'S VALUE

        Earth satellites had been proved
        practical as a Commonwealth radio
        link, the Commonwealth Telecommunications
        Board says in its
        11th report published to-day. The
        experimental ground station at
        Goonhilly, Cornwall, had already
        given convincing proof of this,
        working with Telstar.

        Cyprus, Nigeria and Malaya had
        accepted invitations to appoint
        members to the board, and Ghana
        and Singapore had said they would
        do so. This would increase the
        number of governments in the
        Commonwealth telecommunication
        partnership from seven to 12.

        Telephone traffic over the Commonwealth
        telecommunications
        system increased by 13 per cent. in
        the 12 months ended in March this
        year. Telax traffic was up by 7.6
        per cent., and telegraph traffic by
        1.5 per cent.

        The South East Asia section of
        the comprehensive cable system
        was to be constructed soon by a
        partnership comprising Britain,
        Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
        Malaya and Singapore. There
        would be a cable from Australia to
        Singapore through New Guinea and
        North Borneo, and a cable from
        North Borneo to Hongkong.

        # This is England---or what Telstar might have shown

        By Rosemary McLellan

        BRITAIN planned
        to flash the first
        live programme to
        America by Telstar
        last night.

        Typically British
        scenes were chosen---scenes
        agreed upon by
        the BBC and ITV as
        symbolising Britain in
        1962 in this historic
        programme.

        But what does symbolise
        Britain?

        What do some of Britain's
        best known household
        names think should
        have symbolised Britain
        last night?

        ## So modest

        I asked. And here are
        the results.

        First, we sought the
        thoughts of a duke: THE
        DUKE OF BEDFORD.

        "Look, the Americans
        don't think of us as a
        scientific nation. They
        think we're historic and
        quaint," he said.

        "First, I'd have shown
        them Woburn Abbey and
        me," he said modestly.

        "THEN I'd show them
        the Queen at home at
        Windsor Castle.

        "THEN I'd show them
        Sir Winston Churchill in
        bed. Sir Winston is Britain.

        "THEN I'd show them a
        typical English village---perhaps
        Broadway---and
        naturally the dart-playing
        scene in the local pub.

        "And lastly I'd show
        them the Trooping the
        Colour.

        JOYCE GRENFELL, the
        most English, and among
        the most delightful, of all
        our British actresses was
        the next choice.

        "I would try to show
        that although Britain may
        be an old country she's
        got young talent.

        "We should have shown
        the Henry Wood Promenade
        Concerts.

        "Here you have something
        that has been going
        on for years, but look at
        all the young people who
        go.

        "Then I'd go to Stratford-upon-Avon
        and show
        what young talent we
        have.

        "And finally I'd show
        how Britain is developing
        its nuclear power for
        peaceful purposes."

        On to LORD BOOTHBY,
        Britain's most British politician.

        ## The Derby

        "Britain can best be
        symbolised by showing the
        Coronation. Emphasise the
        Coronation. This is Britain,"
        said Lord Boothby.

        "Then show the Derby.

        "But you must give the
        history and pageantry of
        our country."

        And what about BARBARA
        CARTLAND, Britain's
        upper-class, women's
        author---and the mother of
        Lady Lewisham.

        "We'll start with the
        Changing of the Guard.
        After all . . . you MUST.

        "Then the Twist. You
        realise that everyone, old
        and young, are doing it,
        even on the most formal
        occasions. It quite astonishes
        me."

        "And then there are the
        sky-scrapers.

        "They're everywhere---Hackney,
        for example.
        They should be shown."

        NUBAR GULBENKIAN,
        the flamboyant,
        orchid-loving multi-millionaire,
        said:

        "You must show that
        Britain has a past, a present
        and a future . . .
        and a darned sight longer
        past than America.

        "The Houses of Parliament
        symbolise Britain.

        "So does the Cup Final.

        "And I'd like to see
        some of the newer industries
        of Britain shown to
        America.

        ## New, too

        "Make the Americans
        see that Britain isn't just
        old, it's new as well."

        From this brief survey
        it's obvious that no one
        has the same idea of how
        to symbolise Britain.

        Perhaps, even with
        Telstar, the tourist's will
        still have to see for
        themselves.

        Baseball from space . . . The picture Telstar bounced round the world.

        # TV SPACE SPECTACULAR

        From Page 1

        the cameras moved into
        the space age at Cape
        Canaveral where Telstar
        was launched two weeks
        ago.

        America's first astronaut,
        Col. John Glenn spoke of
        plans for the first manned
        flight to the moon.

        Then it was Europe's
        turn in a transmission
        which started dead on
        time at 10.50 p.m.

        As American commentator
        Howard K. Smith
        called "Go Europe Go"
        through space the face of
        Big Ben was shown on
        the screen and the first
        "live" transmission from
        the old world to the new
        began.

        ## BBC team

        From London, with a
        policeman and policewoman
        talking to two American
        tourists, a BBC production
        team in Brussels switched
        to Paris.

        After the Arc de
        Triomphe the international
        TV cameras showed the
        flodlit Colosseum in Rome
        and then moved to the
        land of the Midnight Sun,
        40 miles inside Sweden's
        Arctic Circle.

        American viewers---through
        Telstar over the
        Eurovision link---saw night
        fishing off the Sicilian
        coast; the world-famous
        Lipiczan riding school in
        Vienna; Eamonn Andrews
        standing on a rock off the
        Lizard; a lifeboat launching
        and the Serbian bible
        in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

        American technicians reported
        reception was better
        than their own transmission.

        ## Gromyko

        Soviet TV authorities
        kept the BBC guessing until
        late last night on whether
        or not they would participate
        in the Telstar programme.

        "I don't know whether
        Russia is taking the programme---I
        don't know
        whether it is technically
        feasible," said Mr. Rex
        Moorfoot, head of presentation
        for BBC television.

        Reports in Geneva say
        Russian officials have
        agreed in principle to Mr.
        Gromyko, Russian Foreign
        Minister, appearing in a
        film for relay to the United
        States via Telstar today.

        The reports say the U.S.
        National Broadcasting company
        received permission
        to film Mr. Gromyko, Mr.
        Rusk, U.S. Secretary of
        State, and Lord Home today
        at the 17-nation disarmament
        conference.

        # Kennedy Will Be Featured On Telstar TV

        (Continued from Page 1)

        broadcast will include sequences
        on the extension of the European
        "Eurovision" network, on European
        art and industrial treasures,
        and broadcasts from Paris, London,
        Belgrade and other European
        cities.

        The U.S. program will be transmitted
        to Europe via Telstar on the
        satellite's 123rd orbit. Besides
        being beamed to Europe, the program
        also will appear live on the
        three American networks--NBC,
        CBS and ABC.

        Featured from Mount Rushmore
        will be the 350-voice choir of the
        Mormon Tabernacle of Salt Lake
        City, Utah. The program also will
        show the 60-foot heads of Washington,
        Jefferson, Lincoln and Theodore
        Roosevelt carved in the
        mountainside.

        ### From Andover

        The American show will be
        beamed to Telstar from Andover,
        Maine, and from Telstar to stations
        at Goonhilly, in Cornwall, England,
        and to Lannion in Brittany,
        France. From there it will be
        transmitted by television lines to
        16 nations in the European Broadcasting
        Union---Austria, Belgium,
        Denmark, Finland, France, Britain,
        Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
        Norway, Portugal, Spain,
        Sweden, Switzerland, West Germany
        and Yugoslavia.

        Top officials in the United States
        and foreign cities will chat by
        phone late this month in a series
        of transatlantic calls relayed by
        Telstar.

        The Bell system announced that
        23 American cities and universities
        would be linked with an equal
        number in 16 Western European
        countries.

        The calls are tentatively set for
        July 26.

        All of the calls will take place
        within an hour's time, with Telstar
        relaying as many as 10 simultaneously
        as it whirls around the earth
        at 16,000 miles an hour.

        TELSTAR, the beachball-sized
        aluminium satellite that gave the
        world the first TV pictures from Space, is
        in trouble.

        The Space messenger---Telstar can handle
        phone calls and telegrams via Space as well as
        TV---is no longer obeying on-and-off commands
        bleeped to it from its United States ground control
        HQ at Andover,
        Maine.

        News of this setback to
        one of the most brilliant
        Space ventures attempted
        by the United States was
        given last night by a
        spokesman of the Bell
        Telephone Company, one
        of the firms closely connected
        with the satellite.

        ## Damage

        One cause of the trouble
        could be that equipment
        aboard the satellite has
        been damaged by excessive
        man-made radiation from
        the United States H-blast
        in Space last July.

        Telstar was launched on
        July 10. It had an estimated
        working lifetime of
        at least six months.

        British viewers saw the
        first two-way transatlantic
        TV programme via the
        satellite about a fortnight
        after the launch.

        # TELSTAR TROUBLE

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Monday.

        Telstar, the communications satellite,
        has developed difficulties after
        more than four months' successful
        operation. The Bell telephone laboratories,
        Murray Hill, New Jersey, said
        to-day it was refusing orders to turn
        its communication receiver and transmitter
        on and off.

        # U.S. "TELSTAR " BILL

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Monday.

        Congress finally approved to-day
        the hotly-contested Bill which will set
        up a privately-owned company, under
        Government supervision, to operate
        communication satellites similar to
        Telstar. The Bill, which had been
        sent back by the Senate with minor
        amendments, was passed by an overwhelming
        majority of 371 to 10.

        # U.S., U.K. Set Clocks Via Telstar Satellite

        Washington---Master clock of the
        U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington
        was synchronized with the master clock
        of the British Royal Greenwich Observatory
        to within 10 microseconds,
        roughly 100 times the accuracy previously
        possible, by means of the Telstar
        communication satellite on Aug. 25.
        This was the first time such synchronization
        has been accomplished by satellite.

        The improved synchronization will
        facilitate experiments and studies of the
        propagation of radio waves at high and
        very low frequencies. It also will be used
        to check the accuracy of the timing
        clock to be carried by the Navy's Transit
        navigational satellite.

        To carry out the synchronization experiment,
        the American Telephone &
        Telegraph Co. station at Andover, Me.,
        and the British station at Goonhilly
        Downs each transmitted time marker
        pulses simultaneously, based on time determined
        from the master clock of its
        own national observatory. Each station
        recorded the instant of its own transmission
        and the instant it received the signal
        from the other. From these two
        measurements it is possible to determine
        the error in synchronization between the
        two master clocks.

        The clock at the Andover station was
        synchronized to the Naval Observatory
        in Washington by means of transmissions
        from a Loran-C station at Nantucket,
        Mass., which is synchronized to
        the master Loran-C station at Cape
        Fear, N.C., which in turn is controlled
        from the Naval Observatory.

        # Telstar Relay

        New York---Trans World Airlines President
        Charles C. Tillinghast, Jr., last
        week completed the first passenger radio-telephone
        call to Europe from an airborne
        jet transport via American Telephone
        & Telegraph Corp.'s Telstar
        communications satellite (see p. 27).

        Tillinghast called Lord William
        Mabane, chairman of the British Travel
        Assn., in his London office, Aug. 29 and
        spoke for five minutes to demonstrate the
        possibilities of future radio-telephone
        communications for passengers flying anywhere
        in the world.

        Tillinghast spoke from 31,000 ft. over
        Lewiston, Pa.

        The call was transmitted to a Bell
        System airborne radio ground station in
        New York, routed to Andover, Me., relayed
        to Telstar, received by the Goonhilly
        station in southwest England and
        routed to Lord Mabane's office in London.

        The radio telephone was installed
        about seven weeks ago in a TWA Convair
        880 (AW July 30, p. 34) to test
        passenger acceptance of the system.

        # EISENHOWER BOUNCED BY TELSTAR

        ## Uncommunicative satellite

        BY W. J. WEATHERBY

        "The first five and a half minutes are the important ones,"
        cried an American voice across the River Room of the Savoy Hotel
        last night. All the assembled newspaper reporters must have felt
        suitably squashed there, at General Eisenhower's press conference,
        by this tribute to Telstar.

        These first five and a half minutes were being televised, or
        Telstarised, whatever the word should be, and this seemed
        to
        dominate the proceedings. The lights
        shone down on the reporters as
        brightly as if they were being grilled
        by the police, and the press photographers
        were asked to restrain
        their flashbulbs in case they upset
        Telstar.

        "One, two, three --- just testing,"
        droned the voices like a litany of 1984.
        The general entered in the middle of
        it, had his picture discreetly taken by
        the newspaper photographers, and then
        sat up on the platform to await his
        cue from Telstar. It looked then more
        like Telstar's occasion than the
        general's, even though it was announced
        as being his first press conference---or
        "news conference" as Telstar preferred
        it---since he retired as President.

        The general was apparently making
        history, or so the announcer could be
        heard saying, as he was appearing on
        Telstar's first (was it Telstar's
        first live news event?) The
        announcer's words got lost on the far
        side of the room as reporters began
        to ripple their notebooks. The British
        reporters there had been asked to
        speak up because---by now we had it
        almost engraved on our hearts---"it's
        being broadcast live in the United
        States and the last thing Americans
        want to hear is their own voice." So,
        some obviously British voices boomed
        out co-operatively and we were away.

        Gradually, as he spoke up, the
        general began to win over Telstar. The
        bright lights seemed to fade before
        his more human grin and obvious wish
        to be obliging in his forthright way.
        Everyone, including Telstar, had been
        told he was not "disposed" to discuss
        official United States foreign or domestic
        policiy. So he ducked a few questions
        inappropriate for a private citizen
        on holiday. But he did repeat his
        opinion that he did not agree that the
        Russians had "necessarily a space
        lead."

        The American space programme had,
        in part, been devoted to other things
        and so you could not compare the two.
        He thought the space programme
        should be devoted to obtaining scientific
        information and, if that was done,
        they would get to the moon as a
        matter of course. Letting it become
        a spectacular space race was not worthwhile
        compared with holding a series
        of scientific explorations, as the Americans
        had done. The Russians had gone
        ahead in certain things, particularly in
        the making of great engines, but the
        Americans would one day do it, and,
        in any case, had done it in other
        things.

        ## Diplomatic

        As for the Common Market, that
        was a very serious problem and he
        was confident Britain would find the
        right solution. For many years he had
        been in favour of freer trade and
        therefore was in complete agreement
        with the general policy. No "outsider,"
        as he called himself, could have been
        more diplomatic. Questioners tried to
        get him off his guard as a private
        citizen about NATO, or about co-operation
        in space research, or about Berlin,
        but he was in complete command of
        the occasion by then.

        Where was Telstar? Were those
        five and a half minutes up, and had it
        gone off to other continents? He
        repeated his view that military and
        economic strength and morale were
        the key factors in a country's health
        and the military should not be allowed
        to get out of hand and upset the other
        two. He thought the morale of Western
        Europe very high.

        A word or two about golf, and then
        he decided to depart. He went off
        through the crowd with his usual beam
        as if unaware he had just made
        history---according to Telstar.

        # Picture in US, but no sound

        New York, August 15

        The transmission to the United
        States by way of Telstar of the London
        press conference of Mr Eisenhower last
        night proved only 50 per cent successful.
        The picture came through very
        well but there was no sound.

        Television network spokesmen here
        said they understood that this was no
        fault of the satellite but that the
        sound failure occurred somewhere
        between the press conference at the
        Savoy Hotel and the British transmitting
        station at Goonhilly Downs,
        Cornwall.---Associated Press.

        # Gen. Eisenhower to visit Wexford after all

        By our Dublin Correspondent

        Mr Eisenhower will arrive in Ireland
        for a two-day visit on Tuesday---and
        he will visit Wexford.

        This decision, which appears to be
        final, is the climax of what has seemed
        at times like a new situation comedy
        from the Abbey repertoire. About
        three weeks ago it was revealed that
        Mr Eisenhower had wished to visit
        Wexford to place a wreath on the
        memorial there to Commodore John
        Barry, the "father" of the American
        Navy; but the corporation had decided
        that it could not receive him.

        The explanation was that the day
        chosen for the visit was inconvenient;
        most of the members of the two town
        bands would be at work and it would
        be difficult to give such a distinguished
        visitor a proper welcome.

        When this story was made public,
        there was an outburst of indignation
        among the people of Wexford. Some
        suspected that the corporation was
        playing Democrats and Republicans---that
        it was demonstrating its support
        for Mr Eisenhower's successor, whose
        great-great-grandfather emigrated from
        County Wexford early in the last
        century.

        The corporation met again and
        reconsidered the matter; an official
        invitation was sent to the former
        President. But by now the United
        States Embassy in Dublin had made
        other plans for the visit. It was
        impossible for Mr Eisenhower to fit
        Wexford into his schedule.

        There was a new message from the
        embassy yesterday, however. Mr Eisenhower
        had prevailed on the US forces
        in Britain to lend him a helicopter so
        that he could visit Wexford and be
        back in Dublin for lunch.

        # Telstar Relays 'Brain' Data In Another 1st

        NEWTON, Mass. (UPI) --- Telstar
        added another first to its
        achievements when it demonstrated
        that communications satellites can
        relay information around the world
        from one earthbound computer to
        another

        A Honeywell Research Center
        computer here sent and received a
        series of messages via the satellite
        which is whirling through space at
        16,000 miles an hour.

        Walter W. Finke, president of
        Honeywell Electronics Data Processing,
        said "The test was a forerunner
        of the high-speed, intercontinental
        computer network that
        in years to come will handle the
        data processing needs of the bulk
        of world commerce."

        J. Ernest Smith, Honeywell's
        vice-president in charge of the
        electronics data processing division,
        explained its practical applications

        ### Within 3 Minutes

        It would, he said, be valuable to
        large corporations with branches
        abroad. Each week, for example,
        the foreign branch could send to
        its home office its employes' work
        schedules. The checks could be
        sent back over the computer within
        three minutes.

        Police departments around the
        world could store in one computer
        all the fingerprints, records and
        descriptions of all known criminals
        and this information could be exchanged
        quickly.

        Other technological data and information
        could be relayed among
        scientists, doctors, lawyers and engineers,
        thus greatly reducing the
        risk of error, he said.

        # TELSTAR PROJECT

        ## "Galling" experience

        Mr. DE FERRANTI (C., Morecambe
        and Lonsdale) said that we
        obviously could not afford a large
        space programme, but how galling
        it had been to sit up on the last
        two evenings to watch the Telstar
        project and know that, except for
        our receiver at Goonhilly, the
        Americans had done it all.

        What a pity that we could not
        have been the pioneers as we
        always used to be. What we
        could do was to form international
        groupings which would enable us
        to be in the lead with these most
        important developments.

        Mr. ALBU (Lab., Edmonton)
        said the great need for industry
        to-day was innovation. There
        should be new products and processes.

        Suggesting the setting up of a
        committee to consider what was
        required in scientific research, Mr.
        Albu said the Treasury was not
        a suitable body to plan scientific
        expenditure.

        # THERE'S ONLY ONE WORD FOR IT---SPACETACULAR!

        TELEVISION'S
        greatest triumph
        gave Britain
        a fabulous "over
        the garden wall"
        peek at America
        last night.

        The great "hi-neighbour"
        show
        started with a baseball
        game in Chicago.

        ## Cheers

        And how that crowd
        cheered and waved
        paper hats when a
        commentator told
        them the match was
        being televised to
        Europe.

        Next---a quick call
        at President Kennedy's
        Washington Press conference
        with close-ups
        of the President
        answering questions on
        H-bomb tests.

        Col. John Glenn
        spoke from Cape Canaveral,
        where Telstar
        was launched thirteen
        days ago . . . cars sped
        on the Detroit Highway . . .
        there was a
        glimpse of Quebec . . .
        actors rehearsing Macbeth,
        in Stratford,
        Ontario.

        ## Dancing

        These shots were
        followed by an Indian
        chief in South Dakota,
        and Japanese girls
        dancing at the World
        Fair, Seattle.

        A look at the United
        Nations . . .

        Then, all too soon,
        a last glimpse of the
        Statue of Liberty and
        the New York skyline
        and the historic show
        was over.

        # Telstar Plan For Tokio Olympics

        TOKIO, Saturday.

        JAPAN announced to-day it will open negotiations
        later this month with the United States on possible
        use of American communications satellites to "telecast"
        the 1964 Tokio
        Olymnics.

        If the Japanese get U.S.
        agreement they plan to broadcast
        the Olympics on an
        "experimental basis" throughout
        the world, according to
        Postal and Communications
        Ministry officials.

        A specific date to open negotiations
        has not been set. Any
        agreement that results will be
        part of a Japan-U.S space
        communications
        project, a
        spokesman said.

        New York cables:

        A newspaper front page has
        been sent into space and back
        in one minute, via the Telstar
        communications satellite. The
        method used in this experiment
        could be applied in publishing a
        world-wide daily newspaper.

        The newspaper-into-space test
        was conducted jointly by research
        engineers of the Westrex
        Communications systems
        Division of Littonsystems Inc.,
        and Bell Laboratory personnel
        of the American Telephone and
        Telegraph Company.---Reuter.

        # ONCE A WEEK TELSTAR TV

        By Our Television and Radio Staff

        The Post Office announced last
        night that an agreement had been
        reached with France and America
        by which the BBC and Independent
        television can relay programmes
        from America via Telstar once a
        week.

        It is not to be allowed more
        often because the communications
        satellite's main purpose is at
        present technical tests including
        special telephone calls. This
        week's programme bounced across
        through space will be transmitted
        at the Radio Show at Earl's Court
        at about 5 p.m. on Thursday.

        # TELSTAR BRINGS ARCTIC TO RADIO EXHIBITION

        By L. MARSLAND GANDER,
        Daily Telegraph Television and Radio Correspondent

        PICTURES of the two United States submarines meeting in
        the Arctic, relayed direct from New York via Telstar,
        were shown at the Earl's Court Radio Exhibition yesterday.
        This was the first use of the satellite for a timed transatlantic
        news bulletin. The pictures,
        which were relayed on closed
        circuit round the show, were
        later shown in broadcast bulletins.

        A Columbia Broadcasting System
        bulletin from New York was
        included in the Telstar transmission.
        There was also an interview
        with Senator Humphrey, a picture
        of Mr. Harry Truman speaking and
        others of aircraft salvage operations
        off Rio de Janeiro.

        ## PROGRAMME FINANCE

        A curious point in the discussions
        about when a second BBC
        television programme on 625 lines
        will start, is the hazy financial
        aspect. The BBC has no precise
        knowledge of where the money will
        come from because of the Government
        statement that it accepts
        resonsibility.

        In the meantime the BBC still
        insists that if it is to maintain its
        independence the extra money will
        have to be raised from licence
        holders. If the Government
        obtained money from Independent
        Television sources, the corporation
        would almost certainly consider
        its independence had been undermined.

        Regardless of the political implications
        the Corporation is going
        ahead. The first transmitter for the
        extra London service on 625 lines
        which has already been installed at
        Crystal Palace, starts its experimental
        broadcasts soon. A colour
        transmitter has also been ordered.

        Obviously in these early stages
        the extra cost will be fairly modest
        but it will work up to the millions
        expected if the television licence
        fee was raised to £6. Crowds
        milling round the BBC stage at the
        show were naturally oblivious of
        these financial considerations.

        # SHARE DEALS BY TELSTAR

        ## PARIS TO NEW YORK

        By Our City Staff

        For about 20 minutes yesterday
        afternoon Telstar, the American
        communications satellite, was used
        to transact Stock Exchange business
        between Paris and New York.

        A French order to buy 100
        shares in American Telephone, the
        makers of Telstar was sent from
        Paris to New York. Details of the
        deal were transmitted back to
        Paris.

        The first deal was done at 3.33
        p.m. and was executed in less than
        one minute, the report back being
        transmitted a few seconds later. It
        was followed by other orders, involving
        nearly 2,000 shares, by
        French personal investors and
        banks to buy shares quoted on the
        New York and American stock
        exchanges and from American
        investors for French securities.

        The deals were done by telephone
        call between the chairman of
        Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
        Smith Inc., the American broking
        firm, and its Paris office.

        ## TELSTAR PROGRAMME

        ## Hammarskjoeld anniversary

        THE United Nations will transmit
        a commemorative television
        programme via the satellite
        Telstar next Monday to mark the
        first anniversary of the death of Mr.
        Dag Hammarskjoeld, the former
        Secretary-General. The programme
        will include ceremonies held in New
        York, Uppsala and Paris.

        Audiences on both sides of the
        Atlantic will be able to see, for the
        first time, a programme originating
        at three different points in Europe
        and North America. The satellite
        will make one orbit during the
        programme.

        # SILENT IKE IN TELSTAR FLOP

        A TV picture of Ike
        speaking at his London
        Press conference was
        beamed over 5,000 miles
        through Space to America
        via the Telstar satellite
        last night.

        But American viewers
        couldn't hear a word he
        said. The sound link broke
        down between the Savoy
        Hotel and Associated Rediffusion's
        headquarters in
        Kingsway---500 yards away.

        A TV spokesman said:
        "It was no one's fault---just
        one of those things."

        # 'Everything appears to be perfect'

        Evening Standard Reporter: Cape Canaveral, Tuesday

        A TRIUMPH! That's the jubilant reaction
        of scientists and engineers here this
        afternoon as TELSTAR, the world's first TV
        satellite, makes its third successful orbit of
        the earth.

        "Everything seems to be
        perfect. We are very proud
        of today's achievement,"
        said a spokesman of the
        National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration.

        All is set for transatlantic
        television.

        Scientists here this afternoon
        were getting ready to
        conduct the first experiments
        in transmitting messages to
        Telstar for relay back to
        earth.

        ### Simple

        Telephone contacts, transmission
        of TV messages and
        black and white pictures are
        planned as soon as the satellite
        passes over the correct
        positions.

        PETER FAIRLEY writes:

        Tonight---61 years and
        seven months after radio
        contact was first made across
        the Atlantic---a picture
        should flash back on to
        British TV screens.

        It will be simple. An
        engineer's test card. Or a
        technician's face.

        ### Staying open

        But it will be historic. The
        BBC and ITV networks will stay
        open until 1.30 a.m. to bring it
        "live."

        Shortly after launching,
        American engineers announced
        that the first test would probably
        be made between midnight
        and 1 a.m. (London time).

        It will be one of the most
        complicated experiments of the
        space age.

        Stay-up-late night---PAGE

        # FRENCH SEE 3min FILM

        ## STABLE PICTURE

        From Our Own Correspondent
        PARIS, Wednesday.

        French television screens showed
        the first pictures transmitted from
        the American Telstar satellite in a
        lunchtime news programme to-day.
        They were generally good, fairly
        clear and stable.

        Viewers likened them to the
        early Eurovision programmes. Some
        three minutes of film were shown,
        beginning with a picture of the
        American flag, followed by a discussion
        among American experts
        who were responsible for Telstar.

        The images were received
        "under excellent conditions" at
        the receiving station of Pleumeur-Boudou
        in Brittany at 12.48 a.m.
        The original film was over seven
        minutes long, but only about half
        was shown. The sound track
        varied in quality, but was continuously
        audible.

        ## Gift from France

        The French Government has
        given the BBC the pictures from
        Telstar picked up in France, M.
        Peyrefitte, French Information
        Minister, said in Paris yesterday.
        "The BBC offered to buy them for
        a high price but France has asked
        the BBC to accept them without
        financial consideration as a gesture
        of Anglo-French friendship."---Reuter.

        ## MR. BEVINS'S PRAISE

        Mr. Bevins, the Postmaster-General,
        said at Battersea last night that the
        radio-telescope base at Goonhilly
        Downs in Cornwall, which received
        the Telstar pictures, was a "great
        tribute" to British Post Office engineers.
        "Ours is the only country
        outside the United States to construct
        a ground station to our own design,
        and a relatively little cost."

        # TELSTAR CABLES A MIRROR STORY

        From STAN MAYS, New York, Thursday

        THE first cable sent by way of America's Telstar
        Space satellite was sent to Britain tonight. It
        was a news report written by me---and flashed to
        the Daily Mirror office in London.

        Before transmitting time, Telstar---whizzing round the
        Earth at 18,000 mph---developed
        "noise" trouble.

        The cable was sent from
        the New York office of the
        Western Union telegraph
        firm, who had booked
        transmitting time from
        Telstar's makers, the
        American Telephone and
        Telegraph Company.

        ## Worried

        Western Union officials
        were worried. But they
        decided: "We'll still try to
        get through."

        A flashing green light
        told us when Telstar was
        ready to pass my cable to
        Britain.

        A girl at a Telex-transmitter
        keyboard called the
        Mirror in London.

        From London came the
        "OK."

        The girl began sending
        my story . . .

        But when she was about
        halfway through, the Telstar
        circuit failed. Three
        minutes later, the satellite
        had spun out of transmitting
        range.

        ## Phone

        I finished sending the
        story myself---by ordinary
        transatlantic phone.

        THE STORY which made
        communications history was
        this:

        America has set a target
        for landing her first man
        on the Moon. The date:
        1966.

        And the man in charge
        of the Moon programme---Professor
        Brainerd Holmes---thinks
        the Russians are
        not likely to get there first.

        The Professor said that
        the target previously discussed
        had been 1968.

        The new date would be
        officially announced by
        American President John
        Kennedy.

        # DOCTORS OPERATE---BY TELSTAR

        By RONALD BEDFORD, Mirror Science Editor

        TOP British skin specialists
        and their patients
        are to star in a doctors-only
        transatlantic TV
        programme via Telstar
        tomorrow.

        And United States scientists
        are to send a six-ton
        telescope to the
        fringes of the atmosphere
        next year for a close-up
        look at the canals of
        Mars.

        These next-steps-in-Space
        projects were announced
        yesterday.

        THE DOCTORS will meet,
        with their patients, at the
        Royal Naval Air Station
        at Culdrose, Cornwall,
        not far from the GPO's
        radio telescope at Goonhilly
        Downs.

        Their pictures, to be seen
        by medical men only, will
        be transmitted via Telstar
        to Washington,
        where 3,000 international
        skin specialists are holding
        a conference.

        The programme opens up
        the possibility of medical
        TV from Space. Top
        specialists in one country
        could direct operations in
        another country where
        life was at stake.

        MORE than 200,000,000 viewers
        in America and Europe saw Telstar
        triumph last night. Two shows relayed
        via the satellite 3,000 miles up gave a
        brilliant send-off to a new era in "live"
        television.

        In 20 breathtaking
        minutes each the new
        world and the old
        exchanged whirlwind
        sightseeing tours.

        Reception in Europe was
        almost perfect, and America
        reported generally good pictures
        as the cameras
        switched to Paris, Vienna,
        London and other cities.

        Europe's programme
        opened with U.S. commentator
        Howard K. Smith telling
        Richard Dimbleby in
        Brussels: "Go, Europe, go."
        But at the end the programme
        neared disaster.

        A minute before the final scenes
        from Britain the Brussels headquarters
        for the nine-country
        hook-up lost contact with
        England.

        Richard Dimbleby hurriedly
        filled in with conversation. After
        ten seconds even he began to look
        concerned.

        ## Lost

        But a few seconds later he said
        "I can now see Cowes, Isle of
        Wight . . ." And on the screen
        flashed a "live" picture of the
        new Hovercraft there.

        The cameras switched to London
        for a glimpse of the Tower
        and its ancient ceremony of the
        keys, and faded out on Big Ben
        and Westminster Bridge.

        But in America the final
        London scenes were lost when
        the picture dissolved in a dazzle
        of broken lines.

        The tour of Europe---on Telstar
        orbit 124---began in London with
        shots of floodlit Big Ben and
        policemen talking to American
        tourists in front of the House of
        Commons.

        Fifty-four cameras moved
        swiftly from shots of the Eiffel
        Tower in Paris; the Colosseum
        and a performance of the opera
        Tosca in Rome; and to
        Sweden, Sicily, Yugoslavia and
        back to Paris and London.

        The American programme,
        relayed on orbit 123, brought
        into European homes President
        Kennedy giving his Press conference,
        spaceman John Glenn,
        Americans on holiday, a baseball
        game and a Red Indian.

        At Cape Canaveral, where Telstar
        was launched two weeks ago,
        Colonel Glenn talked about space
        travel and introduced America's
        next spaceman.

        A shot of a highway in Detroit . . .
        then to the streets of Quebec
        in Canada.

        ## Meditations

        From Chicago came a baseball
        match. At Cape Canaveral, where
        Telstar was launched two weeks
        ago, Colonel Glenn talked about
        space travel and introduced
        America's next spaceman.

        A shot of a highway in Detroit . . .
        then to the streets of Quebec
        in Canada and a greeting in
        French and English.

        On to Custer National Park in
        faraway South Dakota, where
        Americans sat in the sun beneath
        huge rock carvings of past Presidents.

        Then came Seattle's waterfront
        and the World's Fair. . . .
        Two hundred miles up the St.
        Lawrence river to Stratford,
        Ontario, for an excerpt from
        Macbeth at the Shakespeare
        Memorial Theatre.

        The grand tour ended in the
        United Nations building in New
        York. In the meditation room it
        stopped for ten seconds of silence.
        Then, to background shots of San
        Francisco's Golden Gate, Niagara
        Falls and the Statue of Liberty
        the picture faded.

        The European pictures were
        distributed by the G.P.O.'s
        Goonhilly station in Cornwall.

        IT was the first count
        down I have really
        enjoyed. "Five, four,
        three, two, one" --- and
        there was Walter Cronkite
        of C.B.S. introducing Chet
        Huntly of N.B.C., who
        ushered in the first programme
        of Mondeovision
        (I understand this is the
        name to be coined for it):
        Scenes from a baseball
        game in Chicago.

        "All the way from the Wrigley
        Field to the Colosseum in
        Rome," shouted the unseen
        and unknown commentator.

        That the programme should
        switch at once from the cheerful
        friendliness of people to
        the bleak anxiety of international
        politics as depicted
        by President Kennedy's Press
        conference was as sombrely
        apt a comment on Telstar as
        though the script had been
        written by Tolstoy.

        Telstar can never repeat this
        unique occasion. TV is the
        greatest consumer of wonder.
        But on the whole the material
        was adequate for the occasion
        and comparisons between
        the European and
        American contributions would
        be fatuous.

        Between the two they showed
        some marvellous possibilities.
        From Stratford, Ontario,
        came a rehearsal of Macbeth
        and a solicitous phrase from
        Huntly: "By your leave,
        there will be no translation."

        From the Caracalla Baths in
        Rome came a tenor singing
        Tosca.

        The Americans were more concerned
        to emphasise the significance
        of the occasion. And
        if Kennedy's Press conference
        was too formal (he gave
        no recognition of the event)
        and if Colonel Glenn's talk
        from Canaveral contained
        too strong a whiff of propaganda,
        the idea of ending the
        American programme with
        ten seconds of silence struck
        the note that should have
        been sounded somewhere inside
        the 20 minutes.

        The European broadcast gave
        itself the brief of showing
        "the diversity and vigour of
        life in our continent" and
        brought us a superbly
        efficient flicking of pictures
        between nine countries in a
        little over 15 minutes.

        Richard Dimbleby, compering
        the whole thing, maintained a
        blend of sense of occasion,
        unflappability and mateyness
        for which no expression of
        admiration that I can think
        of seems quite enough.

        I think that the Americans got
        a better picture of Europe
        than Europe got of America.
        But, from wherever you were
        looking, it was a heartening
        night for the human race.

        # TELSTAR SHOW

        By L. MARSLAND GANDER

        (Continued from P.1, Col. 7)

        President Kennedy had not
        started his Press conference but
        some excellent baseball pictures
        were shown until at three minutes
        past eight the President was seen
        answering questions. There were
        many close-ups showing him in
        head and shoulders.

        Next came scenes from Cape
        Canaveral where Telstar was
        launched. Col. John Glenn at Mercury
        control talked about future
        space projects.

        The only serious flaw in the picture
        occurred at fairly infrequent
        intervals when it broke up momentarily
        into a kalaedoscopic pattern
        and there were interfering noises.

        ## "MACBETH" SCENES

        ## World Fair pictures

        From Canada there were scenes
        of anniversary celebrations in
        Quebec and of "Macbeth" being
        performed at Stratford, Ontario.
        Cameras dwelt impressively on the
        giant heads of U.S. Presidents
        carved out of rock at Mount Rushmore
        in South Dakota.

        Other pictures were from the
        World Fair at Seattle.

        Then from the United Nations
        building in New York Howard K.
        Smith gave a short talk and called
        for 10 seconds of silence in memory
        of Mr. Hammarskjoeld, the former
        U.N. Secretary-General.

        The closing scenes, before Telstar
        sped out of range, were a moving
        climax to an exciting programme.
        A choir sang "Glory, Glory,
        Hallelujah," there was a glimpse of
        the Niagara Falls, and finally the
        Statue of Liberty before the picture
        broke up.

        ## VOICE RESTORED

        ## Fault at BBC centre

        Richard Dimbleby's voice had
        been restored for the nine-nation
        programme to America late last
        night. The loss of sound between
        Brussels and London, just before
        the American programme, was
        traced to a fault in equipment at
        the BBC Television Centre.

        Pictures seen by American
        viewers of a policeman talking to
        American visitors on Westminster
        Bridge and of the ceremony of the
        keys at the Tower were specially
        effective.

        It was estimated that 200 million
        people on both sides of the
        Atlantic watched what was by far
        the most complex, the most difficult
        and the biggest programme
        hook-up ever achieved in television
        history. Over the longest
        link pictures travelled over 8,000
        miles.

        For once the BBC and Independent
        television co-operated closely
        throughout. Both networks put
        out the two programmes and outside
        broadcast units of the two
        organisations were used on the
        five broadcasts from Britain.

        ## VIEWERS ACROSS WALL

        ## East Berlin reception

        Correspondents of THE DAILY
        TELEGRAPH and agencies included
        reports of reception last night from
        the following centres:

        EAST BERLIN: East German
        viewers were able to hear President
        Kennedy's remarks on nuclear
        tests by tuning into the West Berlin
        channel beamed across the wall.

        ROME: Sets throughout Italy got
        remarkably good reception.
        Engineers said it was "an incredible
        success."

        COPENHAGEN: "For technical
        reasons the broadcast was delayed
        some minutes, but the quality was
        fantastically good," a spokesman
        of the Danish State Television said.

        BRUSSELS: The first pictures
        were rather blurred, but the quality
        quickly improved.

        STOCKHOLM: Picture reception
        was good, but there was some
        sound difficulty.

        PARIS: Pictures were of "impeccable"
        quality ,a French Radio
        spokesman said. Sound quality
        was also "very good."

        NEW YORK: Reception of the
        European programme was almost
        as good as many domestic American
        broadcasts. The programme
        was cut off suddenly as Telstar
        passed below the horizon.

        THE Western
        world shrank
        to the size of a
        television screen
        last night.

        As the blue-and-silver
        Telstar satellite
        swung in orbit 3,000
        miles overhead,
        Europe and America
        exchanged their first
        "live" programmes.

        In both continents reception
        was good and clear---though
        a fused wire in
        Brussels hit the closing
        minutes of Britain's contribution
        to the European
        programme.

        Two hundred million
        viewers in America and
        Western Europe watched the
        programmes.

        ## 16 countries

        And they were joined by
        many in Communist East
        Germany, tuning in their
        sets to the West Berlin
        channel.

        TELSTAR ORBIT No. 123
        brought the American programme
        to 16 watching
        European countries.

        They saw the afternoon
        skyline of New York, baseball
        in Chicago, midday at the
        World Fair in Seattle on the
        Pacific, a buffalo herd in
        South Dakota, a "Macbeth"
        rehearsal from Stratford,
        Ontario, and President
        Kennedy holding a Press
        conference in Washington.

        Apart from breaks and
        flutters from time to time,
        the picture reception was
        near perfect. And later it
        was discovered that the
        breaks were due to a faulty
        switch on the American side.

        TELSTAR ORBIT No. 124
        bounced Europe's programme
        back to America via the
        G.P.O. station at Goonhilly
        in Cornwall.

        The B.B.C.'s Richard
        Dimbleby introduced
        Europe's programme, which
        came from 54 cameras in
        nine different countries.

        ## Arctic Circle

        Big Ben cued "Telstar
        Europe" in and out. A
        London policeman was seen
        in the shadow of Big Ben,
        talking to American visitors.

        The only daylight picture
        came from Northern Sweden,
        40 miles inside the Arctic
        Circle, by the light of the
        midnight sun.

        Then the programme
        switched 2,000 miles to show
        Sicilian fishermen with their
        boats.

        From there to a French
        mobile camera driving up the
        Champs-Elysée, to the Arc
        de Triomphe.

        The cameras crossed to
        Vienna and the Spanish
        riding school with horses
        cantering to Chopin.

        Eamonn Andrews was seen
        a thousand miles from
        Vienna at The Lizard as the
        lifeboat was launched. And
        then the programme
        switched again to Belgrade
        with waving crowds in the
        Square of the Republic.

        ## At Tower

        There was difficulty in
        getting back to London after
        all this, but eventually the
        screens showed a hovercraft
        on Southampton Water
        and the ceremony of the
        keys in the Tower.

        Then, as the cameras
        switched to the Tower, a wire
        fused in Brussels, and a
        technician reported:
        "America has lost us."

        Viewers in Europe were
        unaware of the drama, and
        the programme continued to
        the end, though in America
        the pictures faded.

        One of the team of British
        scientists at Goonhilly said
        later: "One link caused the
        fade-out before the programme
        was quite completed.
        But in every other way
        things were perfect.

        "We're overjoyed that
        everything has gone so well."

        # TELSTAR 'FIRST' FOR BRITAIN

        ## Praise in U.S. for telephone talk

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        WASHINGTON, Friday.

        BRITISH engineers not only
        put themselves "one up"
        over France last night by
        sending the first trans-Atlantic
        telephone message by the Telstar
        satellite, they also jumped
        the gun on the American
        Telephone and Telegraph
        Company, the owners of the
        satellite.

        This "first" in satellite communications
        had been reserved for
        Mr. Eugene McNeely, president of
        the company. He was looking forward
        to making it with to-night's
        call to M. Marette, the French
        Communications Minister.

        Company engineers, accepting
        the Anglo-French rivalry with better
        grace than has been shown on
        the other side of the Atlantic,
        co-operated in the Goonhilly experiment.
        The French station telephoned
        the American control
        centre at Andover, Maine, on the
        satellite's next pass.

        After to-night's talk with M.
        Marette, Mr. McNeely was standing
        by to telephone a General Post
        Office official at Goonhilly. The
        company is maintaining a tactful
        balance in its relations with the
        British and French stations.

        ### EUROVISION LINK

        It congratulated the French station
        for being the first to receive
        and send trans-Atlantic television.
        This was followed up with a congratulatory
        message to Goonhilly
        on the better technical quality

        France has had the lion's share
        of publicity for its "first" in
        trans-Atlantic television, partly
        because it was first and partly because
        Yves Montand and Michele
        Arnaud, the French singers, had
        more glamour than pictures of
        post office engineers at Goonhilly.

        The first formal link between
        America and Eurovision by Telstar
        will be seen on Monday week.
        President Kennedy is expected to
        appear on the 15-minute programme
        that will be seen in
        Britain that evening.

        There will be news pictures of
        the day and of the United Nations
        headquarters in New York. The
        European Broadcasting Union programme
        will be transmitted across
        the Atlantic a few hours later.

        # U.S.-Europe Twin City Telstar Calls Set for Today

        By JOHN KRUEGER

        S&S London Bureau

        LONDON (S&S) --- Twin city
        space calls via Telstar will be
        bouncing back and forth between
        the United States and Europe
        Thursday if present plans go according
        to schedule.

        The U.S. Embassy here has announced
        that England will be represented
        by Rugeley, Staffordshire.
        It will be linked in a telephone
        conversation relayed by the communication
        satellite to its twin
        American town of Western Springs,
        Ill.

        Civic officials of the two communities
        will converse after the
        call has been placed from Western
        Springs. The time will be after
        lunch in Illinois and early evening
        in Rugeley. The towns became
        twins under the People-to-People
        Program for developing better international
        contacts.

        Twenty-three American communities
        or institutions will take part
        in the hour-long Telstar tie-up
        with their counterparts in 16
        European countries. Some 80 Americans
        are expected to take part,
        with conversations lasting five or
        six minutes. Telstar can relay as
        many as 10 calls simultaneously.

        The full schedule will comprise
        New York City-West Berlin;
        Minneapolis-Oulu, Finland; Bay City,
        Mich.-Mechelen, Belgium; Rochester,
        N.Y.-Rennes, France; Western
        Springs-Rugeley; Boston University-Rome
        University; Vallejo,
        Calif.-Trondheim, Norway; Pittsburgh-Bilbao,
        Spain; Chicago-Copenhagen;
        New Bedford, Mass.-Lisbon;
        Hagerstown, Md.-Wesel, Germany;
        Albany, N.Y.-Nijmegen, the
        Netherlands; Alameda, Calif.-Lidingo,
        Sweden; Montclair, N.J.-Graz,
        Austria; University of Wisconsin-University
        of Helsinki; Buffalo-Luxembourg;
        New Bern, N.C.-Bern,
        Switzerland; Denver-Brest, France;
        Menlo Park, Calif.-Galway,
        Ireland; Medford, Ore.-Alba, Italy;
        Artesia, Calif.-Konderkerkaan-den-Rijn,
        the Netherlands; Toledo,
        Ohio-Toledo, Spain, and York, Pa.-Arles,
        France.

        As an example of the twin-city
        program, the embassy here told
        how 900-year-old Rugeley sent official
        greetings and congratulations
        this year to Western Springs on
        the occasion of its diamond jubilee.
        At the jubilee banquet, the citizens
        of Western Springs were entertained
        by a tape recording of music
        specially recorded by a choir
        of 10-year-old Rugeley school boys.

        Copies of the recording were also
        made available to the six elementary
        schools in the Illinois town,
        together with a recorded postscript
        inviting pen-pal letters from the
        Western Springs youngsters.

        On another occasion, festivities
        at Western Springs honoring two
        exchange students from Rugeley
        were filmed and a copy of the film
        was later presented to Rugeley
        when a married couple from Western
        Springs visited Rugeley.

        FOR 18 minutes a vast
        audience of viewers in 16
        European countries last night
        watched the first direct transatlantic
        television programme
        from the United States via the
        Telstar satellite. Both pictures
        and sound from the satellite
        were remarkably clear. Later
        Eurovision transmitted a programme
        back showing European
        scenes as far apart as North
        Sweden, Jugoslavia and The
        Lizard in Cornwall.

        The Statue of Liberty . . .
        The programme's final scene.

        Baseball from Chicago . . . The Philadelphia Phillies beating the
        Chicago Cubs 5-3

        In Dakota . . . The head of Abraham Lincoln, carved out of granite at Mount
        Rushmore.

        At Cape Canaveral . . . Col. John Glenn talking at Project
        Mercury Control.

        The face of North American Indian

        At Seattle . . . Japanese dancers performing at the

        By CLIFFORD DAVIS, Mirror Television Editor

        MILLIONS of viewers in Britain shared in
        the most fabulous TV spectacular of
        all time last night --- the first live
        programmes to be beamed through Telstar,
        the Space satellite.

        Altogether 200,000,000 people in America and
        sixteen Eurovision countries saw two brilliantly clear
        shows in what was certainly TV's greatest night of
        triumph.

        THE FIRST programme,
        lasting twenty minutes, came
        from North America to Europe.
        It took British viewers on
        BBC and ITV networks
        around Canada and the US,
        including shots of a baseball
        game and President Kennedy's
        Press conference.

        ## Brilliant

        THE SECOND programme
        was Europe's contribution---a
        wonderful Grand Tour. Fifty-four
        cameras in nine countries
        from the Arctic Circle to the
        Mediterranean were used---the
        biggest-ever TV presentation
        of its kind. The result? Another
        brilliant success.

        In the next few years transatlantic
        TV and then global
        TV will be taken for granted.

        The relays proved that it
        could be done. These were the
        programmes that will start it
        off. I'm thrilled to have seen
        them. This was tingling television.

        The American programme was
        momentous, exciting. The pictures
        were generally clear and bold and
        the sound strong.

        As live television from more
        than 3,000 miles away, the reception
        was as good as most outside
        broadcasts taking place in Britain.

        This twenty minutes round-up
        was a stupendous triumph of
        Anglo-American technical achievement.

        It was history being made---a
        once-in-a-lifetime moment as
        thrilling as the first transatlantic
        flight.

        "Received loud and clear" was
        the report from most European
        capitals last night.

        For Europe's programme to
        America, BBC and ITV pooled
        their resources for Britain's
        contribution.

        As a programme this grand
        tour of Europe was even more
        effective than the American
        offering.

        ## Problems

        The technical problems which
        were overcome were tremendous.
        Different TV systems are used by
        different European countries.

        At the end of the programme
        some of the pictures broke up
        with distortion because of a technical
        fault.

        My colleague Stan Mays cables from
        New York:

        "I watched British television in
        a 12th floor flat in mid-Manhattan.
        I saw Big Ben clearly.

        "It is as good a picture as I
        saw when I was in London a week
        ago tonight.

        "Then we switched to Paris
        and Rome. Again the pictures
        are as clear as anything I have
        seen in Britain and clearer than
        most American television.

        "If there could be any
        criticism of this miracle of
        television, it is that TOO
        MUCH was offered. The
        people around me could not
        keep pace with the TV
        screen. Fortunately the
        programme was repeated
        several times during the
        night.

        "Unfortunately, just at
        the end of the programme
        we lost the picture.

        "And there we were looking
        at the regular American
        commercials, which
        seemed very tame and unexciting
        after the last few
        minutes, which were an
        enthralling experience in
        my life."

        How was it all done?

        French TV engineers
        picked up the American
        programme from Telstar at
        Lannion, France, and then
        fed the programme into the
        Eurovision TV network.

        British TV engineers received
        the European programme
        through the Eurovision
        TV network and sent
        this to America from Goonhilly
        Down, Cornwall, by
        way of Telstar.

        screens by Mirror cameramen.

        Telstar, the world's first TV satellite, is now making
        its third succesful orbit of the earth. A new era
        in communications has opened. Tonight---61 years and
        seven months after radio contact was first made across
        the Atlantic---a picture should flash back on to British
        television screens.

        It will be simple. An engineer's
        test card. Or a technician's face.
        But it will be historic. The
        BBC and ITV networks will stay
        open until 1.30 a.m. to bring it
        "live."

        Shortly after launching,
        American engineers announced
        that the first test would probably
        be made between midnight and
        1 a.m. (London time).

        ## Global TV

        Global TV. Better long-distance
        radio. Clearer, more
        plentiful telephone links and
        cheaper cables.

        All these brilliant prospects
        have been claimed for the little
        "space post offices," the first of
        which is now whizzing round the
        world at more than 16,000 m.p.h.

        Telstar---170lb. of engineering
        miracles---was blasted up from
        Cape Canaveral by a Thor Delta
        rocket at 9.35 a.m. London time.

        Launch officials said eight
        minutes after launching that
        "everything was going well"
        and the rocket was "coasting."

        Then it soared into a huge egg-shaped
        orbit between 600 and
        3500 miles from earth, its radio
        beacon bleeping merrily, its
        mirrored sides flashing.

        TONIGHT---after it has
        circled the world five times---American
        engineers will command
        it by radio: "Switch on."
        And one of the most complicated
        experiments of the space age
        will start.

        The 34-inch diameter sputnik
        must take in signals from the
        ground, amplify them 10,000
        million times, and re-broadcast
        them on a different frequency.

        ## Test message

        FIRST, a test message. THEN
        a person-to-person call between
        two Americans. THEN some
        "talk" between two computers.
        THEN a news photo. FINALLY---if
        all goes well---the first trans-Atlantic
        picture.

        U.S. officials refuse to confirm
        or deny that one of the first
        people to talk over the link will
        be President Kennedy.

        They said there was a chance
        the "domestic" call will be
        picked up in Europe as well as
        America.

        The space relay station can
        only be used when it is visible to
        both points wishing to communicate.

        And the difficulties of catching
        it in the right spot in the
        sky at the right moment are
        colossal.

        Two huge aerials---a horn-shaped
        monster at Andover,
        Maine, U.S.A., and a big "dish"
        at Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall---must
        pivot with the speed and
        precision of ballet dancers.

        Humans cannot cope with the
        job. Robot brains must be used.

        One Post Office engineer
        described it today as "far worse
        than trying to hit a ping-pong
        ball bouncing on a water jet at
        a fairground."

        ## Two aerials

        The satellite also carries two
        aerials

        One takes in "commands"---allowing
        scientists to switch its
        batteries off when it is on the
        dark side of the earth to conserve
        power.

        The other, girdling its middle,
        relays the TV and voices.

        Scientists hope eventually to
        have about 30 Telstars circling
        the earth so that television programmes
        can be transmitted to
        any city from almost any part
        of the world.

        More than 4500 working parts
        have been crammed into the
        little sphere, cushioned against
        the rigours of a space flight by
        pink plastic foam.

        ## Cost: £20 M

        The project has so far cost
        £20 million---all paid by the
        American Telephone and Telegraph
        Co. as a private gamble.

        For communications satellites
        are expected to become big
        business.

        The launching rocket, and
        certain tracking stations, were
        hired out by the U.S. Government.

        The British Post Office, and
        those in France, Germany, Italy
        and Brazil all eagerly seized
        American offers to join in the
        experiment and relay telephone,
        telegraph and TV messages.

        But only Britain's ground
        station is ready. So to Britain
        will fall the honour of beaming
        and receiving the first "live"
        TV shows between Europe and
        America.

        The two broadcasts next week---each
        lasting 12-15 minutes and
        hooking up many cities on each
        continent---will stream in and
        out of a point only a few miles
        from Poldhu, the Cornish village
        from which Marconi's great radio
        test started in 1901.

        "You have been put through

        # EARLY TELSTAR "REPEAT SHOW" UNLIKELY

        ## TALKS BETWEEN BBC, ITV AND POST OFFICE

        BY OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STAFF

        THE future of Telstar as a transatlantic television relay
        station is to be discussed on Friday by the BBC-ITV
        joint committee, the Post Office and the American company
        which developed the satellite. After the success of Monday's
        programmes both the BBC and Independent Television are
        eager to arrange further programmes from America.

        The possibility of televising an excerpt from the world
        heavyweight championship fight between Floyd Patterson and
        Sunny Liston from Chicago in September will be discussed at
        Friday's meeting. But the Post Office was pessimistic yesterday
        about chances of further programmes
        from America in the
        near future.

        A GPO spokesman said: The
        television show was marvellous.
        But now the real work on Telstar
        begins. We shall conduct experiments
        with radio telephony, telegraphy
        and the transmission of
        information and pictures."

        ## GPO'S RESPONSIBILITY

        ## Experiments the real object

        He said these experiments were
        the real object of the Telstar exercise.
        "The Post Office would
        have to give permission to the
        BBC and ITV for the transmission
        of Telstar programmes and, as
        matters now stand, it is not likely
        it would be given."

        It was possible, however, that an
        exception might be made for the
        use of Telstar for broadcasting
        events of great international importance
        from America or Europe.

        For a 24-hour transatlantic television
        service about 12 satellites
        would have to orbit the Earth. It
        is hoped to put another into orbit
        in September, and another a few
        months later.

        # MIXED VERDICT ON U.S. SHOW

        ## "BANAL" CRITICISM

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Tuesday.

        A leading New York television
        critic to-day described the American
        offering in yesterday's Telstar
        exchange as banal and superficial.
        Jack Gould of the New York Times
        said that by contrast Europe's
        presentation "succeeded brilliantly
        in suggesting the tradition and
        diversity of Europe and underscoring
        its cultural heritage."

        The New York Herald Tribune
        said the American programme
        "evidenced the taste and professionalism
        shown by American television
        at its best."

        Generally American papers gave
        the exchange enthusiastic treatment,
        with pictures reproduced
        from television screens. There was
        widespread approval of the
        European presentation. Richard
        Dimbleby was praised for his performance
        as chief European commentator.

        # Telstar Will Cast Kennedy

        From Press Dispatches

        WASHINGTON---The first exchange
        of live two-way transatlantic
        television programs via the
        American Telstar will take place
        next Monday.

        Part of President Kennedy's
        news conference will be relayed
        live to Europe over the satellite
        link.

        The first transmission from the
        United States to Europe is scheduled
        to take place between 8 and
        8:30 p.m. CET, the second program
        from Europe between 10:45 and
        11:30 p.m.

        FRANCE last night transmitted a short television
        programme to America through the Telstar
        satellite. Night scenes in Paris and a picture of Yves
        Montand singing were successfully received in New
        York on home screens.

        The BBC criticised the French transmission as
        a breach of their agreement with Britain and other
        European countries that had arranged to put over
        a combined programme. The target date was July 23.

        At Goonhilly Downs, in Cornwall, engineers
        yesterday climbed the dish aerial, which received
        poor pictures compared with the excellent image
        seen in France, to make adjustments. These were
        said to bring it back to its condition before
        alterations at the week-end on information from
        America.

        American officials said the French success was well-deserved.
        The station in Brittany, where there are American
        technicians, was similar to the parent station at Andover,
        Maine, in which the horn aerial is geared to an accuracy
        of a thirty thousandth of an inch. The Goonhilly Downs
        station aerial was operated "literally by a bicycle chain."

        # MONTAND SEEN & HEARD

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        WASHINGTON, Wednesday.

        AMERICAN viewers tuned to the major television networks
        throughout the country to-night saw a
        programme from France transmitted
        through the Telstar
        satellite.

        Scenes of Paris at night, and
        Yves Montand and other entertainers
        singing, came through,
        though a little blurred.

        The programme was the first
        east-to-west television transmission
        across the Atlantic. The image
        appeared on American screens 35
        minutes after midnight.---BST.

        France yesterday picked up
        Telstar's relay better than the
        British station in Cornwall, where
        minor adjustments were not made
        in time to get the full picture.

        American officials associated
        with Telstar believe that the
        French success in receiving the first
        image from the satellite was well
        deserved. They say that the
        French have been keeping close
        liaison with the American earth
        station at Andover, Maine.

        ## BRITISH DOUBT

        ## Government permission

        The British, on the other hand,
        are said to have been more independent,
        partly because they
        seemed to be doubtful whether the
        United States Administration
        would authorise a commercial venture
        of the kind now effected with
        the American Telephone and Telegraph
        Company.

        It is also pointed out that the
        British installation at Goonhilly
        does not work on the same technical
        principle as the American
        receiving horn at Andover, Maine.

        One authority said here to-day
        that whereas the American horn is
        geared to be accurate to within
        one thirty-thousandth of an inch,
        the British horn is "operated quite
        literally by a bicycle chain."

        ## PRESIDENT'S PLEA

        ## Greater understanding

        Mr. Kennedy to-day welcomed
        Telstar's success as a prelude that
        "throws open to us the vision of
        an era of international communications."
        The advantage "must be
        grasped to use the medium to
        ensure greater understanding
        among the people of the world."

        Before the end of the month one
        of President Kennedy's Press conferences
        may be televised directly
        to Britain via Telstar.

        # BBC CRITICISM OF FRENCH

        ## BREACH OF PACT

        By Our Radio & Television
        Correspondent

        The decision to transmit a
        French programme to America
        relayed by Telstar was criticised in
        the BBC 9.15 television news last
        night.

        It was said the French action was
        in breach of their agreement with
        Britain and other European countries
        that had arranged to put over
        a combined programme.

        Eight countries are proposing
        to contribute to this, under the
        auspices of the European Broadcasting
        Union. The provisional
        date is July 23.

        The French station at Pleumeur-Boudou
        in Brittany is modelled on
        the American station at Andover,
        Maine. American technicians are
        working at Pleumeur-Boudou but
        the bulk of the 700 staff are
        French.

        ## Satellite to Transmit to U.S., Europe

        # TV Shows via Space Planned in July

        NEW YORK (AP) --- The first
        live transatlantic television programs---to
        be transmitted by a
        communications satellite---are
        planned for next month, it was
        announced here.

        The three American networks
        and European broadcasters will cooperate
        on the project between the
        United States and Europe.

        Two programs will be included,
        an American one to be sent to
        Europe, and a European show to
        be beamed to the United States.

        National Broadcasting Co., Columbia
        Broadcasting System and
        American Broadcasting Co. jointly
        will produce the American program.
        The European program will
        be handled by the European Broadcasting
        Union.

        An announcement by the three
        American networks said transmission
        will be by the Telstar communications
        satellite of the American
        Telephone & Telegraph Co.

        Launching of the satellite on an
        Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral
        is scheduled for early in July by
        the National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration (NASA).

        Exact dates for the transatlantic
        programs will be determined after
        the satellite launching.

        The American program will
        cover by live remote pickups "the
        world of reality and immediacy in
        America as seen at the time of the
        broadcast," the announcement
        said.

        News departments of the three
        networks will produce the program
        and cover what they consider the
        most significant events taking
        place at the time.

        The program to be sent to the
        United States will include live
        pickups from 16 points, representing
        all of Europe. The European
        Broadcasting Union represents 16
        countries.

        Each program is expected to last
        about 12 minutes.

        The American program will be
        coordinated in New York and
        sent by cable to Andover, Maine,
        site of the Bell System's ground
        station.

        From there it will be beamed by
        microwave to the Telstar satellite.
        Telstar will pick up the signal and
        rebroadcast it to two ground stations
        in Europe, one at Goonhillydowns
        in England, and the other
        at Lannion, Brittany, France.

        The European program will go
        from Brussels to Goonhillydowns
        and then be beamed to Telstar.

        The announcement said Telstar
        is expected to complete an orbit
        of the earth about every 2½ hours.
        During a portion of each orbit,
        while over the Atlantic, it will be
        in line of sight with Andover and
        the European stations.

        During these periods the programs
        will be transmitted.

        # 'PANORAMA' BY TELSTAR HOPE

        ## ITV AS WELL

        By Our Radio Staff

        The BBC announced yesterday
        that it hopes to have Richard
        Dimbleby introducing the television
        programme "Panorama"
        from New York. Mr. Dimbleby
        would be acting as compere for a
        10-minute "live" programme
        beamed to Britain through Telstar
        by the United States National
        Broadcasting Corporation.

        Last night N.B.C. spoke of showing
        scenes of the Rockefeller Centre,
        Fifth Avenue, and a drug store.
        Independent Television will also
        receive a 10-minute programme
        compered by Brian Connell from
        New York on Monday evening. This
        will be recorded and shown in
        Britain during the 9 o'clock news.

        # U.S. TO VIEW LANDS END AND ARCTIC BY TELSTAR

        ## JOINT EUROPEAN EFFORT

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        GENEVA, Tuesday.

        THE European Broadcasting Union announced in Geneva
        to-day details of the first European television programme
        to be relayed to the United States next Monday by
        the Telstar satellite. The BBC is providing the executive
        producer, Mr. Aubrey
        Singer, and the commentator,
        Mr. Richard Dimbleby.

        To show the extent of the
        European network the programme
        will include shots taken
        at Gaellivare, in the Artic Circle
        in Sweden, the southern coast of
        Sicily, Vienna and the most
        westerly point, Lands End, in
        Britain.

        There will also be shots from
        London, Paris and Belgrade, the
        Sistine Chapel in Rome, blast furnaces
        at Duisburg in the Ruhr and
        the European centre for nuclear
        research in Geneva.

        The two-way transatlantic programme
        will start with an America
        to Europe broadcast between 8 p.m.
        and 8.30 p.m. The programme
        from Europe to the United States
        will be between 10.45 p.m. and
        11.30 p.m. and will last at least
        15 minutes.

        The President of the Union, Mr.
        Roydbeck, said to-day he "was
        quite satisfied that there had been
        no bad faith and no intentional
        breach of any agreement" during
        Telstar test transmissions last
        week.

        ### POOLING CAMERAS

        ### Magna Carta & Hovercraft

        A BBC spokesman said last
        night that the contribution by the
        BBC and Independent Television,
        who are pooling commentators and
        cameras, would include the Tower
        of London, Westminster Bridge,
        the Houses of Parliament, the
        Magna Carta in the British
        Museum, the Hovercraft at Lee-on-Solent
        and the Lizard lifeboat.

        "Brian Connell will be the commentator
        at the Tower, Ian
        Trethowan will be with the Hovercraft
        and Raymond Baxter at the
        Lizard. Richard Dimbleby who
        gives the English commentary for
        the complete EBU programme,
        will cover the British Museum and
        Westminster sequences." All the
        items would be transmitted "live."

        ### Kennedy conference

        Part of President Kennedy's
        televised Press conference on Monday
        will be relayed by the Telstar
        satellite and shown simultaneously
        in Britain and on the Eurovision
        network. The day's American news
        will also be shown.

        # HIGH QUALITY TELSTAR TEST

        ## Colour pictures success

        BY OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT

        THE Goonhilly team visited
        London yesterday and reported
        that, after three weeks
        of experiment with the satellite
        Telstar, the results had
        exceeded all their expectations.

        High quality circuits were
        proved both for normal, and colour
        television, and blocks of telegraph
        communication where up to 80
        telephone conversations are made
        at the same time. Colour pictures
        received back from the satellite
        appeared indistinguishable from
        pictures about to be transmitted.

        Telstar also exceeded expectations
        in the time it is usable on
        any one transit. Before launching,
        scientists felt the satellite would
        have to be 5-7 deg. above the
        horizon before signals could be
        satisfactory.

        In fact, reception and transmission
        are both good when the satellite
        is half a degree above the
        horizon. The satellite is then
        actually about one degree under
        the horizon, but due to refraction
        of radio waves it appears to be just
        above.

        ### COSTS CUT LIKELY

        This means that in future one
        satellite would provide a longer
        service between two countries than
        had been imagined. Some of the
        foreseen expense would thus be reduced.

        Capt. C. F. Booth, in charge of
        the communication satellite project
        for the Post Office, admitted that
        poor reception from the satellite on
        its first possible transit over Britain
        was due to human error. It seems
        someone misread international
        agreements about polarisation of
        waves.

        This polarisation error meant
        that the aerial was not organised to
        receive radio waves in the same way
        that they were transmitted. One
        small part was set at 90 deg to the
        position it should have been in.

        When this part was turned
        through 90 deg the Goonhilly aerial
        worked perfectly.

        By TOM MERRIN

        TWO hundred million viewers
        in Europe and North America
        last night tuned in to the two
        greatest television shows on earth---or
        space.

        Europe and North America
        swapped two 20-minute programmes---two
        and a half hours apart---as the
        130lb. Telstar satellite made its 123rd
        and 124th orbit, bouncing the shows
        10,000 miles through space.

        Nine European nations entered into
        the Europe-America transmission, picking
        up "live" scenes from Sweden's Arctic
        Circle---to a Sicilian fishing port.

        At three minutes to
        eight last night Telstar
        beamed its message
        through to 200 millions
        in Europe, America,
        Canada and Mexico.

        This was the first Telstar
        attempt at a live TV
        programme---and a fabulous
        success. Reports from
        Madrid, Brussels, Paris,
        London and othe European
        capitals described the 18
        minute space reception as
        excellent.

        In Britain viewers watching
        the BBC TV service
        were given a nine-minute
        "build up" to the programme.

        ## New York

        Then the first live picture
        came through---a dim hazy
        shot of the Statue of
        Liberty filled the screen.

        For two minutes shots of
        the New York skyline and
        San Francisco's Golden
        Gate Bridge were shown.
        Then with correspondents
        translating in six languages
        the programme opened
        with a one-minute excerpt
        from a baseball game in
        Chicago.

        For five minutes President
        Kennedy was shown at
        his regular Washington
        Press conference answering
        questions on H-bomb tests
        and American strength in
        the international gold market.

        Then for three minutes

        # ERA IN WORLD CITIZENSHIP

        By Frank Taylor in New York and John Bulloch in London

        WE bounced our voices 2,500 miles up into space to
        cover the 3,000 miles between London and New
        York last night. In the first public demonstration of the
        satellite Telstar, we girdled the earth in a five-minute
        conversation which could
        mark the beginning of a new
        era of world citizenship.

        In New York, Taylor took a
        taxi six miles to an office on
        6th Avenue in the middle of the
        American afternoon. In London,
        Bulloch walked round the corner
        from Fleet Street to the
        new Post Office building in
        Farringdon Street.

        The conversation went like this:

        FROM NEW YORK: "This is New
        York via Telstar . . . John, hello."

        FROM LONDON: "Frank, I've had
        worse lines to Kensington."

        On both sides of the Atlantic
        tension mounted as the engineers
        in New York and London spoke
        by direct line to their satellite
        tracking stations. The link had
        been announced two days earlier.
        But with a satellite 2,500 miles up
        in space, travelling at 16,000 miles
        an hour, many things could go
        wrong.

        ### FIRST MESSAGE

        ### A call for London"

        At 9.24 p.m. an engineer at
        Goonhilly reported that the giant
        aerial there was starting to move
        to track the satellite in its expected
        course over Britain. By 9.27 p.m.
        the satellite was five degrees above
        the horizon, some 5,500 miles
        away.

        At 9.30 p.m. the first call from
        New York came through. The
        stereotyped tones of an operator
        there said: "I have a call for
        London." And history was made.

        The first words of the first
        public call across the Atlantic via

        # TRANSATLANTIC TV RELAY BY TELSTAR NEXT WEEK

        ## SATELLITE TO LINK BRITAIN AND 7 NATIONS WITH U.S.

        By L. MARSLAND GANDER,
        Daily Telegraph Television and Radio Correspondent

        EIGHT European countries will contribute to the first
        east-west television programme relayed across the
        Atlantic by means of the American satellite Telstar. The
        satellite is due to be launched from Cape Canaveral on
        Tuesday or Wednesday.

        Immediately after the firing, attempts will be made to show
        brief flashes on British screens of a test card from the United
        States' ground station at Andover, Maine. Mr. Peter Dimmock,
        of the BBC, said yesterday that if the launching came at a reasonable
        time programmes would be interrupted. If it were in the
        small hours a recording would
        be taken for showing later.

        For Transatlantic communication,
        the satellite's broadcasts
        must be in a mutually visible position
        to the ground stations in
        Europe and America. The only
        one ready in Europe is the £750,000
        Post Office station at Goonhilly
        Down, Cornwall.

        ### 15-MIN. PROGRAMME

        ### Provisional date

        A programme of only 15 minutes
        will be possible and eight countries
        will therefore have slightly less than
        two minutes each. They are
        Britain, Austria, France, Germany,
        Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

        Mr. Aubrey Singer has been
        seconded by the BBC to produce
        the European programme, which
        is under the auspices of the
        European Broadcasting Union. The
        provisional date is July 23, but
        there are many uncertainties.

        Mr. Singer said a change of plans
        had switched the probable timing
        of the programme from daylight
        to night-time, with the exception
        of the Swedish part.

        It had been necessary to think
        again about the nature of the items,
        which were intended to show something
        of the wonder and diversity
        of Europe.

        ### OTHER USES

        ### Picture transmission

        Television is only a small part
        of Telstar's function. There will
        be extensive experiments in telegraph,
        telephone, teleprinter and
        facsimile picture transmissions.

        The BBC has installed television
        cameras at Goonhilly Down to
        show pictures from there as opportunity
        presents. It is estimated
        that the American Telephones and
        Telegraph Company has spent
        more than £4 million in producing
        Telstar and its Andover Earth
        Station.

        The British Post Office has not
        only spent much less on its ground
        station but also completed the
        only European receiving centre in
        good time for the first experiments.

        through the Telstar satellite. It
        was made between the Paris and
        New York offices of Air France for
        a businessman travelling from
        France to Mexico City.

        # 200m SEE FIRST LIVE TV SHOW FROM U.S.

        ## BASEBALL BROADCAST IS LOUD AND CLEAR

        THE first live television programme from the
        United States to be seen in Europe was
        watched by an audience in 16 countries estimated
        at 200 million last night. Pictures and sound, relayed
        from the Telstar satellite, were both clear.

        The link was made at 7.57 p.m. before President Kennedy
        was ready to inaugurate the historic programme with
        a Press conference. So the first live transatlantic pictures
        were of a baseball match in
        Chicago.

        The return transmission was
        made at 10.58 p.m., when the
        Telstar satellite had made
        another circuit of the earth.
        Richard Dimbleby linked the
        contribution from nine European
        countries, which opened
        with a view of Big Ben.

        The 18-minute programme was
        seen and heard in millions of
        American homes. The sound was
        perfect but the picture was grainy
        with slight blurring round the
        edges.

        # 18 MEMORABLE MINUTES

        ## RELAY FROM FRANCE

        By L. MARSLAND GANDER,
        Daily Telegraph Television and Radio
        Correspondent

        NEARLY perfect pictures
        from America were
        relayed to Europe via the Telstar
        satellite last night for 18
        memorable minutes.

        Viewers in 16 countries saw and
        heard President Kennedy answering
        questions at a Washington
        Press conference. It was part of
        a coast-to-coast mosaic of live pictures
        assembled and transmitted
        with lightning speed.

        This first direct transatlantic
        television programme, as distinct
        from tests, was relayed through the
        French receiving station at Lannion
        in Brittany.

        The Post Office receiving station
        at Goonhilly, Cornwall, was
        standing by to relay the American
        transmission. But Post Office headquarters
        said that the French
        relayed the American broadcast
        and Goonhilly transmitted the
        European programme to America
        later.

        ### AGONISING TENSION

        ### Silent Richard Dimbleby

        At the start there were minutes
        of agonising tension and uncertainty.
        On British screens Richard
        Dimbleby was seen in the Brussels
        control room of the European
        Broadcasting Union, his mouth
        opening and shutting but with no
        sound coming over.

        But at two minutes to eight a
        picture of the Statue of Liberty
        could be seen vaguely on one of the
        Brussels monitor screens.

        Suddenly, exactly on time, it was
        a clear picture from New York,
        and, considering the difference in
        definition standards, remarkably
        good.

        # BBC and ITV offered 15 'live' minutes of Patterson v Liston

        NOW SPORT COMES ZOOMING INTO THE SPACE AGE.

        And the first big transatlantic event which may
        be seen live in this country is the sensational,
        multi-million dollar world heavyweight title fight
        between the two American Negroes, champion
        Floyd Patterson and sinister challenger Sonny
        Liston which takes place---in the flesh---at
        Comiskey Park, Chicago, on September 25.

        The current success of Telstar---the satellite
        which can relay live television pictures thousands
        of miles across the world --- has made this a
        distinct possibility.

        Mr. Sheldon Graff, a king-sized Californian tycoon---he
        heads eight corporations at the last count---outlined
        his plan to colleague Michael Grade from his penthouse
        suite at an exclusive London hotel last night.

        ## To Highest Bidder

        "The syndicate who run Telstar have been in touch
        with my company and inquired whether they could
        relay part of the fight," said Mr. Graff.

        "We agreed at once, and I'm in London to sell the
        film and TV rights of the fight to either the BBC or
        ITV, whoever bids the largest.

        "It would be up to them whether or not to use Telstar,
        but certainly the opportunity is there for them to take.

        "The fight is scheduled
        for 10 p.m., so it would be
        4 a.m. in London.

        "It would depend on the
        position of the satellite
        which part of the fight
        would be seen in Europe.

        "The Telstar organisation
        estimate showing
        about fifteen minutes of
        the fight."

        ## Gamble

        Mr. Graff heads the
        syndicate of three business
        men whose bid of 2,000,000
        dollars [£714,283] for the
        ancillary rights of the
        championship---these include
        closed circuit TV
        across America, film and
        radio rights---has been
        accepted by Championship
        Sports Incorporated, who
        promoting the fight.

        "This is our first venture
        in this field," said Mr.
        Graff. "It's a fantastic
        gamble, and we are already
        committed to over 3,000,000
        dollars [£1,071,525] worth
        of guarantees.

        "But we expect to gross
        around 6,000,000 or 7,000,000
        dollars in the end." [Over
        £2,000,000.]

        "My own personal aim as
        a boxing enthusiast is to
        ensure that both fighters
        reap full reward for their
        labours.

        "The money they make
        from TV and other things
        will, for tax purposes, be
        put in trust for them.

        ## Steady

        "They will get 300,000
        dollars [£107,142] in the
        first year, and 100,000 dollars
        [£35,714] every year
        for eighteen years or more,
        depending on their investments.

        "This is the first time
        that boxers will have been
        paid in this way, but it will
        ensure that when they
        have finished fighting they
        will have a steady income."

        Interest throughout the
        world is enormous. Mr.
        Graff expects to sell the
        film of the fight to countries
        as far apart as Sweden
        and Japan.

        ## Moscow

        Even Moscow Radio have
        inquired about the possibility
        of a sound commentary
        direct from the ringside.

        And, with Telstar taking
        part, this will be not only
        the richest-ever fight, but
        the most historic.

        The sporting prospects
        opened up by this spinning
        satellite are enough to take
        your breath away.

        Last Sunday, for instance,
        we could have seen
        in our own living rooms
        Valeriy Brumel casting off
        the shackles which have
        made man earthbound as
        he sprang to a fantastic
        new world record of 7ft.
        5in. in Palo Alto, California---some
        6,000 miles away by
        earthly reckoning but a
        mere hop, skip and a jump
        to the whirling Telstar.

        Everyone with a price of
        a television licence may be
        able to tune in to the next
        Olympic Games in Tokio
        in 1964.

        The football pitches of
        Brazil, the cricket grounds
        at Sydney and Melbourne,
        the swimming pools of
        California---all, all in time
        will be laid out on our
        home carpets.

        ## 12-15 Minutes Possible

        # Europe Might Watch Floyd Tiff by Telstar

        LONDON (UPI) --- The world
        heavyweight championship fight
        between holder Floyd Patterson
        and Sonny Liston at Chicago Sept.
        25 may be "bounced" live off Telstar
        to television viewers in Europe.

        Announcing the possibility, Sheldon
        Graff, top man of the Los
        Angeles group which holds ancillary
        rights to the fight, added:
        "There's one big snag, of course.
        We'll get only 12-15 minutes of the
        fight in because Telstar's position
        at the time has to be taken into
        account.

        "This means we may get the
        start of the fight away, but not
        the end. But it's a chance worth
        taking."

        Graff's group---himself, David
        Reiner and Martin Smith---paid $2
        million for the rights and hope
        to gross $6 million in American
        and worldwide sales through television,
        radio and movie coverage.

        Graff was to start negotiations
        Tuesday with the British Broadcasting
        Corporation and the commercial
        television authorities here.
        Highest bidder wins. Then on to
        Paris, Stockholm and Rome, where
        he will conduct talks with the
        continental networks.

        "Even the Russians are interested
        in this one," Graff says.

        # 'Everything appears to be perfect'

        Evening Standard Reporter: Cape Canaveral, Tuesday

        A TRIUMPH! That's the jubilant reaction
        of scientists and engineers here this
        afternoon as TELSTAR, the world's first TV
        satellite, makes its third successful orbit of
        the earth.

        "Everything seems to be
        perfect. We are very proud
        of today's achievement,"
        said a spokesman of the
        National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration.

        All is set for transatlantic
        television.

        Scientists here this afternoon
        were getting ready to
        conduct the first experiments
        in transmitting messages to
        Telstar for relay back to
        earth.

        ### Simple

        Telephone contacts, transmission
        of TV messages and
        black and white pictures are
        planned as soon as the satellite
        passes over the correct
        positions.

        PETER FAIRLEY writes:

        Tonight --- 61 years and
        seven months after radio
        contact was first made across
        the Atlantic --- a picture
        should flash back on to
        British TV screens.

        It will be simple. An
        engineer's test card. Or a
        technician's face.

        ### Staying open

        But it will be historic. The
        BBC and ITV networks will stay
        open until 1.30 a.m. to bring it
        "live."

        Shortly after launching,
        American engineers announced
        that the first test would probably
        be made between midnight
        and 1 a.m. (London time).

        It will be one of the most
        complicated experiments of the
        space age.

        # 'DISAPPOINTING' TELSTAR PICTURES IN BRITAIN

        ## TRACKING STATION FOUND TROUBLE WITH AERIAL

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        NEW YORK, Wednesday.

        REPORTS in New York to-day from American correspondents
        in London emphasise the disappointing quality
        of the reception at Goonhilly Downs of the first pictures
        from Telstar. Messages from Paris, on the other hand, said
        that reception on the coast of Brittany had been excellent.

        In the New York Herald Tribune Mr. Richard C. Wald
        described the picture in Britain as "fuzzy, unsteady and
        bouncing." He added that the hesitating picture of Mr. Frederick
        Kappel, chairman of the American Telephone and Telegraph
        company lasted for about
        one minute before the signal
        from America was cut off.

        "Even that short picture was
        almost missed, as the tracking station
        had great difficulty in swinging
        the 121-ton aerial in the proper
        tracking orbit to pick up Telstar."
        Mr. Wald stated.

        "Although British engineers had
        hoped to catch the communications
        satellite as it came over the
        horizon at 12.45 a.m., they missed
        it until 1.02 a.m., as technicians
        nervously watched dials and radar-scopes
        that stared blankly back."

        ### "SOME DIFFICULTY'

        ### Aerial steering

        In the New York Times Mr. Seth
        King reported that for 14 minutes
        nothing was picked up. He quoted
        Mr. W. J. Bray, of the Post Office
        team at Goonhilly, as saying: "We
        are having some difficulty resolving
        the signal.

        "We have not had experience yet
        in the art of steering the aerials to
        receive a signal from a moving
        satellite. However, you can see
        that we are making some progress."

        Of the reception in Brittany it
        was said that the pictures were so
        clear that the French station
        reported they appeared as if they
        had been sent by a station only 20
        miles away.

        American Telephone and Telegraph
        Company stock opened
        slightly higher on the New York
        Stock Exchange this morning and
        after about 45 minutes had risen
        more than one point.

        This picture, shown on BBC television yesterday, was transmitted
        from Andover, Maine, and received in the early hours
        at Lannion, Brittany, after being relayed from the American
        satellite Telstar. Pictures flown to Paris and then broadcast
        on the Eurovision link to Britain showed technicians at Andover
        receiving the news from Lannion that the transatlantic
        transmission was successful.

        # OUT OF THE 'COMPLEX'---TELSTAR

        Telstar, the successful American communications
        satellite launched last month, gave this country a
        vital first in space. It also was an achievement for
        which private industry and the military services
        deserve credit.

        Telstar represents an investment of about $53
        million by the American Telephone & Telegraph
        Company. The radio receiving equipment located at
        Andover, Maine, grew out of a Bell Laboratories
        effort that goes back to 1939.

        At that time technicians in Bell Labs were involved
        in a research effort without knowing what
        final application would be found for their work. It
        was work that was put aside for higher priority
        items during World War II and taken down from
        the shelf when the technology developed during that
        war led to the possibility that military missile capabilities
        would push us into the space age.

        The propulsion for Telstar came out of the joint
        efforts of USAF, Douglas Aircraft Co., the Rocketdyne
        Division of North American Aviation, and
        their associated subcontractors in the Thor missile
        project.

        # Europe, America Swap TV Tours via Telstar

        (Continued from Page 1)

        first wavering sight of the Statue
        of Liberty as Telstar came over
        the Atlantic horizon, the image
        was as clear as if the program had
        originated in Europe.

        After a brief tour of Cape Canaveral
        and the Seattle World's Fair
        Europe's watchers were taken to
        Custer National Park for part of a
        concert by the world-famed 350-voice
        Mormon Tabernacle Choir at
        Mt. Rushmore, S.D. The program
        then swung to New York for a
        visit to United Nations headquarters.

        Some three hours later, on the
        next orbit of the 170-pound American
        satellite orbited three weeks
        ago, the Europeans reciprocated.
        They beamed to America glimpses
        of Lapland girls and reindeer,
        fishermen in Italy, London's Big
        Ben and Old World splendor of
        continental art treasures.

        In Berlin, officials reported that
        residents of East Berlin and East
        Germany tuned into West Berlin
        stations and picked up parts of the
        program although they could have
        been arrested if caught.

        Radio Free Europe said Poland
        and Hungary have reported news
        of the satellite in some detail, but
        the satellite has been "played
        down" in Romania and Czechoslovakia.

        Scientists on both sides of the
        Atlantic hailed the exchange as a
        success. The U.S. program lasted
        18 minutes and the European show
        19 minutes. But the European show
        ran overtime, causing the end to
        fade as the Telstar, traveling
        around the earth at 16,000 miles an
        hour, moved out of range of the
        receiving equipment.

        Also hailing the experimental
        exchange was the Vatican Radio,
        which said global television "can
        open the way to an ever more vast
        affirmation of truth and victory
        over error, ignorance and deception."

        The American show was reported
        "sharp and clear" throughout
        the 16-nation European television
        organization. The European
        show came in clear in America
        but was marred by the blackout of
        the finale.

        At his televised press conference,
        Mr. Kennedy spoke of East-West
        relations. The conference
        was scheduled to coincide with the
        exchange program.

        The first voice from Europe
        via Telstar, was that of Richard
        Dimbleby of the British Broadcasting
        Corp. (BBC). He said:

        "Hello, America, are you seeing
        our pictures?"

        There was a close-up of Big
        Ben, London's famous clock. The
        hands showed the time as 10:58.

        "Go, Europe, go," said Howard
        K. Smith in a New York City control
        room.

        From there, the 54 cameras
        spotted throughout Europe took
        Americans on a dramatically swift
        tour starting at Gaellivare, Sweden
        50 miles above the Arctic Circle,
        where Lapland farmers herded
        reindeer and Lapp lass Maj-Lis
        Skaltje proudly showed off her
        white reindeer calf.

        A mobile unit took Americans
        down the Champs Elysees to the
        Arc de Triomphe in Paris; to the
        houses of Parliament and Westminister
        Bridge across the Thames
        in London; to the European Broadcasting
        Union Center in Brussels;
        to Yugoslavia and Belgrade's
        Republican Square and the National
        Museum where a 12th Century
        Serbian document, the Gospel of
        Miroslav, is kept.

        Viewers were shown the Sistine
        Chapel in the Vatican with
        glimpses of Michelangelo paintings,
        then back to the British Museum
        in London and a picture of the
        Magna Carta, and to France for a
        quick visit to the Louvre Museum,
        a look at Winged Victory of Samothrace,
        and other art treasurers.

        # TELSTAR WILL TUNE US IN TO KENNEDY

        From BRUCE ROTHWELL
        WASHINGTON, Tuesday.

        TELSTAR the TV satellite
        will bounce the
        start of President Kennedy's
        Press conference
        on to the screen in British
        homes next Monday.

        The live Transatlantic space
        programme from Washington
        is planned to begin
        about 8 p.m. British Summer
        time.

        Three hours later, on Telstar's
        next orbit, Europe will bounce
        a programme back to the U.S.

        The 15-minute American transmission
        will include a short
        concert by the 350-voice
        Mormon Tabernacle Choir
        from Mount Rushmore, South
        Dakota.

        There may also be shots of the
        UN in New York, the Stratford
        Shakespeare Festival in
        Canada, the Seattle World's
        Fair and scenes from Mexico.

        ## Big Ben

        Signals from Telstar will be
        picked up at Goonhilly Downs,
        Cornwall, and by the French
        station at Pleumeur-Bodou. They
        will then be relayed to 16
        nations in the European Broadcasting
        Union, with telephoned
        translations of the commentary
        in six languages.

        The return programme from
        Europe will give American
        viewers an "ancient and
        modern" glimpse of Britain,
        with shots of Big Ben, Beefeaters
        at the Tower of London
        and the Saunders Roe skimcraft.

        B.B.C. and ITV will pool cameras
        and commentators for the
        broadcast, and eight nations
        will combine in a kaleidoscope
        of scenes from Paris to Rome,
        the Ruhr to the Arctic Circle.

        # THE STORY OF TELSTAR

        UNLESS they knew better, many people used to think of the Post Office
        as a rather dull and unexciting place. The launching of TELSTAR
        proved to such people that the Post Office is not just an organisation
        which sells stamps, issues dog and radio licences, and collects and
        delivers your letters. It is also responsible for communications.

        The Post Office Engineering Department,
        for instance, employs hundreds of
        engineers, scientists and technicians who
        are always exploring for possible ways of
        improving the present-day methods of
        communications, not only in this country
        but all over the world.

        When TELSTAR was launched into
        orbit round the earth, high-quality TV
        pictures were passed backwards and forwards
        across the Atlantic Ocean between
        Europe and America by way of the
        satellite.

        Of course, as you know, TELSTAR
        was actually put into orbit by the Americans
        from Cape Canaveral. For the previous
        two years, however, the Post Office
        Engineering Department had been experimenting
        to see whether satellites could
        provide better world-wide communications.
        These engineers decided that there
        were great possibilities in the idea and,
        when they visited America in 1960, their
        hopes were strengthened. Out of it came
        the decision of the G.P.O. to co-operate
        with American engineers in the TELSTAR
        experiment!

        Although there was much excitement
        when the TV pictures were sent across
        the Atlantic via TELSTAR it was not the
        most important thing to the Post Office
        Engineers. To them, the discovery of
        foremost importance gained from the project
        was that they had proved it was
        now technically possible to use a number
        of earth satellites to give world-wide
        communications. This would consist of
        several hundred telephone and telegraph
        channels and one or two TV channels.
        TELSTAR was only the beginning!

        Radio messages will be sent without the
        fading and distortion which occurs at
        present. In fact, people on both sides of
        the Atlantic Ocean will eventually be able
        to see regular simultaneous live TV
        broadcasts. And this will extend to the
        whole world when satellite communication
        becomes an everyday thing.

        # A LITTLE BACKGROUND

        AS you read this, Telstar is speeding
        round the earth. So, let's look
        back for a moment to the very
        FIRST TV picture that was sent across the
        Atlantic Ocean.

        The first picture to cross the Atlantic
        was transmitted almost 35 years ago; and
        the man responsible for sending it was
        John Logie Baird --- very often called the
        'father of television.'

        Baird's system of TV was a mechanical
        one. It was first demonstrated in 1926 and,
        three years later, used for public transmissions
        in Germany and Great Britain.
        It was finally replaced by the modern
        electronic system in 1936.

        Nevertheless, in February, 1928, Baird
        transmitted TV pictures from England to
        America. The first picture transmitted was
        of a ventriloquist's dummy. You can see
        this dummy for yourself in the Science
        Museum at South Kensington, London. The
        following month Baird sent a TV picture
        of a woman from London to the ship
        Berengaria, 1,000 miles out at sea.

        You probably wonder why we had to
        wait so long --- until Telstar --- before
        the engineers repeated Baird's triumph?

        To answer this question you must look
        at the 'ionosphere.' This is the region
        of the earth's atmosphere which extends
        from about 40 miles, to possibly over 400
        miles, above the surface of the earth.

        In the 'ionosphere' there are various
        'layers' which are electrically charged.
        These layers act like mirrors to radio
        waves. That is, they reflect or 'bounce'
        them back to earth. This explains
        how radio waves can travel right round
        the earth, bouncing alternatively between
        one or other of the layers and the earth.

        Different layers reflect different wavelengths;
        but not one of them will reflect
        the extremely short waves we use for
        modern TV. Indeed, these waves would go
        right through the natural reflecting layers.
        This is why Telstar became necessary.

        Very short waves are needed to get
        high quality TV pictures. On the other
        hand, Baird's TV pictures were sent by
        very much longer waves --- and this was
        only possible because the quality of his
        pictures was so poor. His waves were
        bounced back by the ionosphere and the
        transmission of his TV pictures to America
        was made possible.

        # WHAT IS TELSTAR?

        TELSTAR is an ideal device for the
        transmission of TV pictures across
        the Atlantic Ocean. But this was not
        the real reason for putting it in orbit. The
        real reason lies in microwave radio.\*

        Already, microwave radio carries bulk
        communication over the land. Lines of
        towers are used to relay straight-line
        signals around the curvature of the earth.
        But it is clearly not possible to build lines
        of towers across the oceans --- and so you
        can understand why TELSTAR was
        necessary.

        What exactly is TELSTAR?

        TELSTAR is a satellite containing electronic
        equipment for receiving signals
        from a transmitter on the ground. It
        boosts the signals and then re-transmits
        them to a distant receiving station. It can
        do this so long as the satellite is in line of
        sight from both stations at the same time.

        TELSTAR orbits the earth in 158
        minutes in an oval-shaped path 500 miles
        above the earth at its nearest point and
        3,000 miles at its furthest.

        TELSTAR sends out tracking signals to
        help ground stations to follow it across the
        sky. In addition, it sends out signals telling
        us the state of the space immediately
        around itself and also of its own internal
        parts. Inside TELSTAR there are more
        than 15,000 electronic parts. Its power
        comes from 3,600 solar cells mounted on
        its skin. These solar cells convert sunlight
        into electricity.

        TELSTAR, surprisingly, is not very
        large --- only 34 inches in diameter. It is
        painted sapphire-blue and silver, and it
        was launched by a Thor Delta three-stage
        rocket.

        When it was launched it was given a
        spin of 180 revolutions per minute so as
        to impart to it what is called 'gyroscopic
        stability'. This simply means that it will
        point in the same direction in space, at
        least during the first few months of its life.

        As TELSTAR speeds round the earth,
        its visibility from Goonhilly, Britain's
        first space communications terminal, and
        Andover, Maine, U.S.A., will be limited
        to about 30 minutes each of three or four
        consecutive passes during each 24 hours.

        \* MICROWAVE RADIO is very short wave radio.

        # HOW TELSTAR WORKS

        TELSTAR is an 'active satellite'. That
        is, it receives signals from a transmitter,
        it amplifies or boosts them
        and then it re-transmits them to a distant
        receiving station. It can work in either
        direction.

        The signals from a satellite are very
        weak, so a massive radio-telescope aerial
        is needed to collect them. The one in England
        is at the Post Office establishment at
        Goonhilly. It is 85 feet in diameter and is
        used for both transmitting and receiving.
        It has to be able to follow the satellite, but
        it is so well-balanced that only two motors
        are used to turn its 870 tons. In normal
        conditions only a few h.p. are necessary
        for control. In heavy winds greater power
        is needed, and the motors are capable of
        generating up to 100 h.p.

        The movement of the aerial has to be
        very accurate indeed, because:

        (1) The signal it sends out is concentrated
        in a very narrow beam.

        (2) Satellites move rapidly across the
        sky.

        The aerial is steered by feeding information
        received from the Goddard Space
        Flight Centre in America into a computer.
        The computer then works out
        second-by-second tracking instructions
        which are fed automatically to the aerial.

        The actual power of the signal available
        at the receiving aerial is less than one-billionth
        of a watt. (This must not be confused
        with the power output of the satellite,
        which is, of course, much greater.)
        This extremely small amount of power is
        increased by a special amplifier working
        at a very low temperature.

        A quarter of a mile away from the
        giant aerial, and connected to it by a mass
        of cables and wires, is the Control Room.
        On top of the Control Room is a tower in
        which a Post Office engineer keeps watch
        on numerous dials and instruments.
        Although the steering of the aerial is
        automatic, this man can over-ride the
        automatic system if faults occur.

        The aerial can be checked for alignment
        on local and distant points whose
        bearings are accurately known. It has a
        special boresight telescope for this purpose.

        # BOOSTING AND BOUNCING

        TELSTAR has already been described
        as an 'active' satellite. It will now be
        useful to look at the two kinds of
        satellites that could be used for worldwide
        communications; that is, 'active' and
        'passive' satellites.

        An 'Active' satellite contains complex
        electronic equipment which receives signals
        from the ground station, boosts them and
        re-transmits them to the distant ground
        receiving station.

        A 'Passive' satellite simply acts as a
        reflector. That is, it does exactly the same
        job as the natural reflecting layers in the
        ionosphere (see page 2). However, it is
        much more reliable than the natural layers,
        because the position of its reflecting surface
        is always accurately known. This is
        not so for the natural reflecting layers of
        the ionosphere. They are affected by other
        solar activity, which is why radio communications
        suffer from fading and distortion
        so badly at present.

        An example of a passive satellite is the
        metalized balloon which was launched by
        the Americans in August, 1960, and
        called Project 'Echo'. It is 100 feet in
        diameter and travels round the earth at a
        height of about 900 miles. In August,
        1960, signals were bounced off the balloon
        and received by Post Office and Royal
        Radar Establishment engineers in England.
        This balloon still circles the earth
        and it can occasionally be seen in the
        night sky, looking like a fairly bright star.

        The Americans are also interested in
        another kind of passive satellite --- a very
        large number of fine metal needles about
        half-an-inch long --- which they plan to
        scatter all round the earth, to form an
        artificial ionosphere. Their idea is to project
        a canister containing the needles into
        an orbit round the earth. The canister will
        then disintegrate and the needles will
        spread into a continuous belt.

        A passive satellite only reflects
        signals. An active satellite fitted
        with a receiver and transmitter,
        picks up signals from a ground
        station, amplifies and re-transmits
        them.

        # AFTER TELSTAR --- WHAT NEXT ?

        NOW that TELSTAR has proved
        itself, you may have wondered what
        might grow out of it. Already in
        both the United Kingdom and in America
        there are nation-wide microwave (very
        short wave) radio networks: and satellites
        could extend them to the whole world. A
        great deal of further research will have to
        be carried out before this comes about.
        But there are grounds for hoping that
        satellites will be used extensively within
        10 years or so.

        What kind of satellites do you think
        will be used --- active or passive?

        How many satellites will be required?

        What kind of orbits will they have?

        No one knows the answers to these
        questions yet --- not even the engineers
        who are busy working on them. But there
        are one or two possibilities so far as orbits
        are concerned.

        One interesting possibility is to have a
        circular orbit round the earth's equator.
        If the satellites were about 22,000 miles
        above the earth, and travelled in the same
        direction as the earth's rotation, they
        would have an 'orbital period' of 24
        hours. In other words they would appear
        stationary in the sky; so that only these
        satellites would be necessary to cover all
        but the polar regions of earth.

        A serious disadvantage of this system
        would be that transmission time --- more
        than half a second --- would be a little too
        long for many telephone users. It
        would not, however, affect TV or telegraph
        users.

        The time-delay problem could be partially
        solved by having the satellites orbiting
        much nearer to the earth, say, at
        nearly 9,000 miles height. Their orbital
        period would then be only 12 hours.
        Using this method about 12 satellites
        would be needed to give world coverage.

        # CONTROLLING TELSTAR!

        THESE are some of the outstanding
        features of Telstar developed by the
        Post Office Engineers:

        A large part of its equipment is given
        over to (1) measuring what are called
        'environmental conditions' --- or, the state of
        space immediately around itself. This will
        increase knowledge of space for what
        might become the everyday travel of the
        future; (2) measuring the performance of
        its own parts. Altogether 115 items are
        measured and reported. These include
        such items as the temperature of the skin
        of the satellite and how much sunlight it
        receives.

        To get the information, commands have
        to be sent to the satellite from the ground.
        Once it has received a command, it sends
        information until it is given a second
        command to stop. Whilst it is sending information,
        each item is signalled once
        every minute. The information is sent in
        a coded form for convenience.

        When all the electronic parts of the
        satellite are working at the same time,
        they will drain more electrical power
        from the batteries than can possibly be
        replaced from its solar cells. Therefore,
        in order not to waste power, parts not in
        use can be turned on and off from the
        ground through its command system.
        Most equipment in the command system
        is duplicated in case of failure of a particular
        part. No command can be given
        until a special 'enable' code is sent.

        After about two years, a timing device
        in the satellite will cut off its tracking
        transmission so that its wave-length can be
        used for other purposes without interference.
        The principal wave-lengths can be
        cut off at any time. If the command to do
        this should fail, then the batteries will be
        drained so quickly that transmission will
        come to an end in a few hours.

        # COMMUNICATION ON THE MOON

        WE have looked at TELSTAR in some detail so far as communications
        on the earth itself are concerned. But sooner or later, man will leave the
        earth, land on the moon and establish bases there. How will he communicate
        between bases which are widely separated?

        Ordinary radio will be useless --- because
        the moon has no appreciable ionosphere
        reflecting radio waves. To make matters
        worse, the moon is very small and its
        curvature correspondingly great and its
        horizon very near. The moon is so curved
        that even an aerial as high as the Eiffel
        Tower would be completely below the
        horizon at a distance of 20 miles!

        The possible solution seems to have
        been unwittingly indicated by the great
        French mathematician Lagrange (1736--1813).
        Lagrange showed that in an ideal
        earth-moon system there are FIVE points
        at which small objects can revolve and
        keep constant positions as viewed from
        either body. If a spaceship could scatter
        'needles' in the vicinity of TWO of these
        points they would serve as reflectors for
        signals between any TWO places on the
        surface of the moon.

        Of course, the earth-moon system is not a
        mathematically ideal one. But Lagrange's
        purely theoretical reasoning might give
        new leads towards a practical solution.
