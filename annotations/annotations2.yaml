        # A balloon goes up---922 miles

        Technicians are dwarfed by Big Shot, the largest man made
        object to be sent into space. The balloon, 135ft in diameter, as
        tall as a 13-storey building, went 922 miles high after being
        launched this week by a Thor rocket from Cape Canaveral.

        [NOTE] [Video of (probably) this balloon inflating](https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2018/10/30/big-shot-2-a-shiny-space-balloon/).

        That page claims Big Shot 2 was launched on September 18th 1962 and reached 250 miles, but I believe this is incorrect: the Cape Canaveral [Spaceport News](https://www3.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/617656main_dec20-1962.pdf) and the NASA report on [Astronautical and Aeronautical Events of 1962](https://archive.org/details/astronauticalaer00unit/page/125/mode/1up?q=%22Big+Shot%22) list Big Shot launches on January 15th 1962 (failed at 250 miles) and July 18th 1962 (reaching 922 miles), with none in September.

        ELEVEN airmen who were to take part in
        America's attempt to put another man into
        Space at the week-end were killed in an air
        crash yesterday.

        The eleven men were members of a rescue
        team which was to stand by in Nairobi, Kenya,
        in case the Space capsule has to make an
        emergency landing in East Africa.

        The giant transport
        plane carrying the team
        and their equipment
        crashed into mountains
        thirty miles out of Nairobi.

        ## '50-50'

        The eleven Space
        specialists and the plane's
        crew of three were killed.

        Will this hold up the
        Space flight of astronaut
        Scott Carpenter?

        An official at the US
        Space base at Cape Canaveral,
        Florida, said last
        night: "We don't know
        yet. But we only have a
        fifty-fifty chance of getting
        him off on Saturday, anyway,
        because of bad weather."

        ## Shepard Tells Aims of Next U.S. Space Flight

        # Carpenter to Have Big Role in Orbit

        POINT ARGUELLO, Calif. (UPI)
        Scott Carpenter will have more to
        do with the success or failure of
        his earth-orbit flight than any
        other astronaut on previous Russian
        and American space flights,
        according to Alan B. Shepard.

        Shepard said the projected Carpenter
        flight, set for Thursday,
        would be "the most man-controlled
        orbital space flight" on record.

        "Carpenter will have more leeway
        and flexibility in controlling
        attitudes and angles of his spacecraft,"
        Shepard America's first astronaut
        to make a space flight,
        told a news conference. Shepard
        will be Carpenter's capsule communicator
        here at Mercury Station
        No. 1.

        Shepard said he expected to have
        little to do on Carpenter's flight
        and predicted full success.

        Asked about his own ambitions,
        Shepard stated he hoped to be the
        first man on the moon. He was
        asked if he thought he was too
        old in view of the years it will
        take to develop the U.S. moon program.

        "Not at all," responded Shepard,
        now 38 years old.

        Referring to the immediate future
        and the Carpenter flight,
        Shepard said:

        "He will test several visual devices
        that were low priority on
        John Glenn's flight and which
        Glenn didn't use," Shepard said.

        Carpenter's flight will have the
        same trajectory as the flight made
        by Glenn, first U.S. astronaut to
        orbit the earth. He also will try
        to sight flares shot up from
        Woomera, Australia, which Glenn
        could not see because of cloud
        cover.

        "And there are several new
        things we will try," Shepard said.

        "For one thing, we will try to
        get better pictures of the luminous
        particles that Glenn spotted on
        his flight."

        Shepard said the Carpenter capsule
        also will use a balloon which
        will be released from the tail of
        the capsule, a device to tell how
        much tension or drag exists as
        well as molecular density.

        On May 5, 1961 Shepard was
        boosted by a Redstone rocket to
        an altitude of 117 miles in the
        first manned sub-orbital flight attempted
        by the U.S. He arrived
        here earlier this week to work on
        the Carpenter flight.

        Shepard also stated:

        ---"I think we will eventually find
        life outside solar system.
        I think it is not only possible it
        will be intelligent life, but more
        intelligent than on earth."

        # Spaceman will take a 'beach ball'

        AMERICA'S next Spaceman,
        Lieutenant
        Commander Scott Carpenter,
        will trail a striped
        balloon like a beach ball
        behind his Spaceship
        when he goes into orbit
        round the Earth later
        this month.

        It will be used to find out
        whether there really is a
        complete vacuum in
        Space.

        Scientists who thought this
        was so now believe there
        may be tiny particles
        which cause friction.

        The balloon will be able to
        measure this friction "resistance"
        to a travelling
        object.

        Space officials at Cape
        Canaveral, Florida, said
        last night that the
        earliest date for 37-year-old
        Carpenter's trip will
        be next Thursday.

        along the balance rail at Cape Canaveral to keep in shape for his
        orbital flight Thursday. ---Associated Press Photo

        # Slayton May Be Choice For Next Orbit Attempt

        NEW YORK (AP) --- With Astronaut
        M. Scott Carpenter still
        waiting for a chance to blast into
        orbit, space officials may have already
        settled on their next candidate
        for space: Donald K. Slayton.

        Carpenter, a Navy lieutenant
        commander, is now scheduled to
        orbit the earth three times no
        earlier than Thursday.

        Unofficially it was learned that
        technicians were readying another
        Mercury space capsule and that it
        may contain Slayton's space couch.

        Slayton, a 38-year-old Air Force
        major, was originally named to be
        the astronaut for the present
        space shot.

        But doctors discovered a small
        irregularity in his heartbeat and
        ruled him out of the attempt.
        Carpenter, 37, backup pilot for
        both Slayton and John H. Glenn
        Jr., was named to take Slayton's
        place.

        If present information is correct,
        it means that Slayton has
        been reinstated and will make the
        third U.S. space shot around the
        world.

        Sources also indicated that the
        number of orbits for the third U.S.
        orbital shot has not yet been decided.
        Presumably, if the Carpenter
        shot is a success, there will be
        no reason to repeat the three-orbit
        mission. The number of orbits may
        be boosted to either seven or 18.

        The number selected will depend
        on the success of Carpenter's flight,
        and the confidence which Project
        Mercury officials have in the present
        rocket and capsule configration.

        # USAFE Teams Link Chain Of Aurora 7 Monitor Sites

        WIESBADEN, Germany (Special)
        --- USAFE elements at four
        scattered points on the African
        continent stood ready in the event
        that astronaut Scott Carpenter's
        space capsule went awry.

        Altogether, 20 ships, 110 aircraft
        and 13,000 servicemen of the Army,
        Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps
        were involved in support of the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration's Aurora 7 manned
        flight in the four general areas of
        launch, network (range), recovery
        and bioastronautics.

        Support provided by the Department
        of Defense elements for the
        space shots is limited only by their
        primary responsibilities for national
        defense.

        Here in Europe, EUCOM Hq has
        assigned responsibility for contingency
        recovery to Gen Truman H.
        Landon, USAFE commander-in-chief.
        Aircraft, helicopters, communications
        and medical support are
        provided by both USAFE and
        USAREUR units.

        These forces deploy to four African
        bases including Ben Guerir AB,
        Morocco; Kano, Nigeria; Nairobi,
        Kenya; and Salisbury, Southern
        Rhodesia.

        Col H. C. Wilder, commander of
        the Atlantic Air Rescue Center at
        Ramstein AB, Germany, heads
        these deployed teams. He also acts
        as the mission coordinator for Project
        Mercury contingency recovery
        operations in the Mauritis area.

        Air Force Communications Service
        provides operators for much of
        the point-to-point equipment linking
        the 16 deployed or alerted Air
        Unit teams and control centers
        with the Mercury control center at
        Cape Canaveral, Fla.

        ## 3 Orbits Planned for Astronaut

        # Scott Carpenter Ready to Ride 'Sky High' Saturday

        By HOWARD BENEDICT

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)---Lean,
        handsome Scott Carpenter
        is about to embark on a journey
        whose dangers and fascination are
        known to only three men---a pulsating
        orbit ride more than 100
        miles above the earth.

        If the present schedule holds,
        Carpenter, outfitted in a silver
        space suit, will ride an elevator
        to the 11th level of a red and
        white rocket service tower on
        launch pad 14 early Saturday
        morning.

        He will wiggle into a cramped
        space capsule---which he personally
        has named "Aurora 7"---and
        sometime between 7 a.m. and 12:30
        p.m. he will be shot into space by
        an Atlas missile.

        Astronaut John H. Glenn Jr. took
        the same dramatic steps last Feb.
        20. His successful flight is now
        history. He circled the earth three
        times and became a new hero
        whom the United States ecstatically
        embraced as a symbol of this
        nation's great pride---a symbol of
        America's intent to be the first to
        land a man on the moon.

        Two other men have experienced
        orbital flight, the Russians Yuri
        Gagarin and Gherman Titov.

        Glenn's flight proved that man
        can survive for at least short periods
        in the eerie weightless environment
        of space, and that he
        can operate under stress in this
        strange new world.

        Carpenter is to expand on the
        knowledge gained from Glenn's
        ride. What he and other astronauts
        learn in the next few years
        will ease the path which future
        American spacemen will take to
        the moon late in this decade---and
        eventually to the moon, Mars,
        Venus and other planets.

        Carpenter's assignment basically
        is the same as Glenn's. The flight
        profile calls for him to whirl three
        times around the globe in 4 hours
        56 minutes at the speed of 17,500
        miles an hour.

        But many changes have been introduced,
        some of them to correct
        problems which cropped up on
        Glenn's flight. Others give Carpenter,
        37-year-old navy lieutenant
        commander, a number of
        unique assignments---including observation
        of a trailing balloon,
        ejection of man-made luminous
        particles, study of liquid in weightlessness
        and several photographic
        duties.

        Near the end of Glenn's first
        orbit, the automatic control system
        in his capsule malfunctioned
        slightly. Two small jets which emit
        streams of hydrogen peroxide gas
        to help keep the spacecraft properly
        oriented became clogged.

        This caused the capsule to drift
        off the planned attitude and Glenn
        took over manual control of the
        craft the last two orbits, conclusively
        demonstrating that man
        is better than machine in space.
        Without a human pilot, the capsule
        would have been ordered to
        the ground after the second orbit,
        just as Enos the chimpanzee was
        when his craft developed similar
        problems in a preliminary Project
        Mercury flight last November.

        The fault was traced to the
        breaking up under excessive heat
        of a stainless steel screen at the
        mouth of the jet fuel line, with
        pieces of the screen being sucked
        into the line. Platinum wire, which
        is highly heat resistant, has been
        substituted for the stainless steel
        on Carpenter's capsule.

        Carpenter will try many experiments
        Glenn was unable to
        carry out because of his occupation
        with the manual controls.
        Among them are observation of
        the stars, exercising, eating more
        frequently, and preplanned manual
        control tests.

        Actually, about half the flight is
        planned to be automatic and half
        manually directed. At times, "Aurora
        7" will be permitted to drift
        off its intended attitude course to
        determine what happens to communications.
        This could afford a
        hint to the type of radio antennas
        which will be needed on moonbound
        spaceships.

        # Spaceman waits---to hear GO!

        By Ronald Bedford

        PLANS to blast
        America's
        second Spaceman
        into orbit tomorrow
        are being speeded
        up.

        Although the
        weather situation
        does not look too
        good, the signal at
        Cape Canaveral
        was still set at
        "Go" for Commander
        Malcolm
        Scott Carpenter,
        pictured left.

        The 37-year-old
        Commander was
        the standby pilot
        when Colonel John
        Glenn was waiting
        to make his triple
        orbit.

        Carpenter's two-ton
        Aurora Seven
        Spaceship is
        already mated to
        the 107D Atlas
        rocket that will
        carry it into orbit.

        His flight, like
        Glenn's, is planned
        as a three-orbit
        mission.

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
        (AP)---The intended orbital
        flight of astronaut Scott
        Carpenter---scheduled for
        Saturday---has been postponed
        until Tuesday so additional
        sensing equipment can
        be installed in his Aurora 7
        spacecraft.

        The sensing equipment dictates
        when two parachutes open after
        re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere
        to ease the capsule to
        Earth.

        At 21,000 feet on the way down,
        the sensors automatically unfurl a
        small parachute to stabilize the
        craft---and at 10,000 feet the 63-foot
        main chute unfolds.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration announced
        the decision to install the additional
        equipment was based on an
        analysis of data from the orbital
        flight last Feb. 20 of astronaut
        John H. Glenn Jr., a Marine
        lieutenant colonel.

        The analysis showed the parachutes
        on Glenn's Friendship 7
        spacecraft opened too soon, the
        announcement said.

        The postponement announcement
        came as preparations for the flight
        were marred by a plane crash in
        Africa which killed 14 Air Force
        personnel, mostly mechanics, who
        were ferrying parts to be used on
        planes involved in emergency rescue
        work as part of the worldwide
        network set up to recover Carpenter.
        (See story on Page 2.)

        ## Better Weather Possible

        The postponement may give
        threatening weather in the Atlantic
        a chance to clear.

        A NASA spokesman said Carpenter
        took the delay calmly and
        was quoted as saying: "This is part
        of the continuing process toward
        attaining reliability---taking advantage
        of past flight experience---and
        it gives us a better chance to
        work with confidence."

        Lt Col John A. Powers, Mercury
        astronaut spokesman, reported detailed
        analysis of Glenn's flight
        showed the parachutes deployed
        too quickly. He did not elaborate
        nor did he say whether this situation
        affected Glenn's flight adversely.

        Glenn landed safely, although
        several miles from his intended
        drop zone, and was recovered by
        a destroyer.

        Powers said a second sensing
        system is being installed to eliminate
        the possibility of early parachute
        deployment.

        Asked why the problem came up
        less than two days before Carpenter
        was to blast off, Powers
        replied:

        "In evaluating a flight, there
        are 90 million things to do. When
        it comes down to the countdown,
        this is the time people toe the
        mark and ask why this or that
        didn't work before."

        # Carpenter Spacecraft Given Careful Checkup

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)---Technicians
        were checking Aurora
        7, the Mercury spacecraft
        of U.S. Navy Lt Cmdr M. Scott
        Carpenter and its Atlas launching
        rocket in painstaking detail.

        If they find no more "bugs"
        in capsule or missile, if the
        weather holds and if other factors
        all are favorable, then the
        Aurora 7-Atlas combination will
        blast of Thursday between 7 a.m.
        and 12:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) (1 p.m.

        # Countdown On For Carpenter Shot Thursday

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
        Project Mercury director Walter
        C. Williams ordered a start on the
        countdown for Malcolm Scott Carpenter's
        orbital flight after a favorable
        weather forecast and a report
        that all elements were in "go"
        condition.

        The man-in-space chief told engineers
        and technicians to proceed
        with launch preparations and to
        pick up the first part of the two-day
        split countdown beginning
        early Wednesday.

        ## Delayed 4 Times

        Carpenter's four-times delayed
        flight into orbit is set for between
        7 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. (EST) Thursday
        (1 p.m.-6:30 p.m. Central European
        Time).

        The weather odds were pegged
        at about 60-40, and space agency
        officials reported no technical
        problems.

        Smoke from swamp fires in the
        Everglades, 200 miles to the south,
        posed the only major problem. But
        officials appeared confident it
        would dissipate enough for tracking
        cameras to do their work.

        CAPE CANAVERAL
        (AP)---Project Mercury commanders
        are in the final
        countdown for astronaut Malcolm
        Scott Carpenter's triple
        orbit of the globe with a target
        hour of 7 a.m. (noon
        GMT) Thursday.

        Mercury operations director
        Walter C. Williams started the
        final countdown at 11 (4 a.m.
        Thursday GMT) Wednesday night
        after getting fine reports about
        the weather, the Atlas booster
        rocket and the Aurora 7 spacecraft.

        Main concern of launch directors
        was acrid smoke spreading over
        much of Florida from a giant
        swamp fire in the Everglades, 200
        miles south of here. A lesser fire 20
        miles west of the cape added to the
        problem.

        If delays occur because of
        weather, forest fire smoke or
        mechanical bugs, blast-off time
        could be as late as 10:30 a.m.
        (3:30 p.m. GMT), and if the Atlas
        bearing Carpenter's Aurora 7
        spaceship does not get off by 10:30,
        the big adventure is to be postponed
        for at least another day.

        ## No Less Than Three

        This is because Project Mercury
        officials are determined to shoot
        for no less than three orbits, and
        a launch time later than 10:30
        would not allow sufficient daylight
        to assure Carpenter's safe recovery
        from the Atlantic.

        As the final countdown started
        Wednesday night, everything was
        reported in a "go" condition, including
        the rocket and the capsule.
        Navy Lt Cmdr Carpenter went to
        bed early, to be awakened at 1:15
        a.m. (6:15 GMT) for a brief physical
        examination and other last-minute
        routine.

        The decision to set the deadline
        at 10:30 a.m. (3:30 p.m. GMT) was
        a new development.

        But it was felt the smoke would
        clear sufficiently by morning to
        permit camera coverage of the Atlas
        during the critical first 2½
        minutes of flight when the rocket
        and its powerful engines are subjected
        to the stiffest aerodynamic
        buffeting in the struggle to push
        through the earth's heavy atmosphere.

        a stand-in whom fate made a
        star, stepped onto the floodlit stage
        of America's newest space spectacular

        His pre-dawn entrance, from the

        Cape Canaveral, May 24

        Lieutenant-Commander Malcolm Scott Carpenter, the second
        United States astronaut to complete three orbits of the earth, was
        rescued from the sea tonight after almost three hours in a life raft.
        For about forty minutes planes and ships had searched frantically
        for the capsule in which Commander Carpenter made his flight.

        He was estimated to have "splashed down" at 6.41 p.m. BST
        but his capsule overshot by about 200 miles the planned landing area.
        Trackers had lost contact with the capsule as it re-entered the
        earth's atmosphere, but after half an hour's silence, in which the
        tension mounted here, signals were picked up by a searching plane
        from the capsule's automatic beacon. Then came the first sighting
        report.

        Colonel John Powers, Project Mercury press officer, announced:
        "A Navy Neptune has reported sighting the spacecraft floating in
        the landing area. Alongside it was a liferaft, and sitting in it was a
        gentleman named Carpenter."

        When a helicopter finally reached the spot to take Commander
        Carpenter to the aircraft carrier Intrepid, he told his rescuers: "I
        am feeling fine." Doctors who
        examined him said later that his
        condition was good.

        News of the successful recovery was
        telephoned to President Kennedy in
        Washington, who issued the following
        statement:

        "The American people will be
        gratified by the successful orbital
        flight of Lieutenant-Commander
        Scott Carpenter and his subsequent
        rescue. The skill and initiative of
        those who participated in the rescue
        of Commander Carpenter, coupled
        with Commander Carpenter's courage
        is heartwarming to all of us."

        It was stated at Cape Canaveral
        tonight that the fact that the spacecraft
        landed 200 miles from the
        planned recovery area may have been
        due to one of two causes: (1) in
        order to conserve his dwindling fuel
        supply Commander Carpenter pointed
        the capsule in "too shallow" an altitude
        towards the earth during re-entry;
        (2) the firing time of the retro-rockets
        might have been miscalculated. Officials
        said that a difference of one
        second in timing would make a difference
        of 30 to 40 miles in the landing
        spot.

        ## Survival package

        Commander Carpenter had a survival
        package with him consisting of
        liferaft, desalting kit, shark repellent,
        dye-markers, first aid kit, portable
        radio, whistle, signal mirror, and food.

        The astronaut began his flight (1.45
        p.m. BST) after the smoothest countdown
        in the history of the Mercury
        programme, but at one stage officials
        feared that it might be necessary to
        end the flight after the second orbit
        because fuel for the control system
        was running low.

        The fuel consumption rate which
        worried officials was of hydrogen
        peroxide squirted out in jet form from
        small nozzles around the capsule. If
        the capsule shifts off course, the jets
        fire to bring it back to its proper
        relationship with the horizon. The
        astronaut can control the attitude of
        the capsule by using his manual controls
        to fire these jet streams.

        The capsule was over Australia when
        the astronaut was warned about the
        fuel situation and he switched to
        manual control. After he was told
        that if the fuel level dropped any
        lower the flight would be ended, Commander
        Carpenter replied: "I'll be
        sure to stay on manual." Mercury
        officials later decided to go for three
        orbits in spite of the fuel position.

        Commander Carpenter experienced
        difficulties as he travelled round the
        earth at 17,532 miles an hour. He
        also noticed the "space fireflies"
        observed by both John Glenn and
        Gherman Titov---and carried a camera
        specially to photograph them. At the
        end of his first orbit he reported
        seeing small particles---"It could be a
        light snowflake," he said.

        Ground stations momentarily lost
        Commander Carpenter as he passed
        over the Atlantic 99 miles out in space,
        but within minutes he was talking to
        the station in the Canary Islands, off
        the West Coast of Africa.

        As he was approaching Muchea, in
        Western Australia, about 50 minutes
        after the launching, he reported that
        his space suit had heated up to 82
        degrees Fahrenheit. He was given
        medical advice to limit his bodily
        movements until it cooled down. He
        tried to lower the temperature by
        adjusting the controls on the capsule's
        cooling system.

        Later he reported that his suit temperature
        was down to near normal and
        he would eat his "midnight snack"
        shortly. He said he had "paused for
        a moment to pick up a washer out
        of the air" as it floated weightless
        in the cabin.

        Commander Carpenter ate some
        chunks of compressed food as he swept
        across Australia and reported to
        Woomera that eating solid food in
        space presented "no problem at all,"
        although some of the food crumbled
        a bit in the cockpit. He also found
        no difficulty in drinking after, and he
        planned to take further drinks later
        in his mission.

        The Muchea station told the astronaut
        that the flare experiment at
        Woomera had been cancelled because
        of heavy cloud cover over Australia.

        ## Balloon experiment

        As he began his second orbit, he
        pressed a switch to release a multicoloured
        balloon 30in. in diameter on
        the end of a 100ft. nylon rope. The
        aim of this experiment was to learn
        what colours are most distinguishable
        in space. He reported: "The balloon
        is out. It is waving out in the back." It
        was swinging at the rate of about once
        a minute or minute and a half. The
        astronaut trained his pistol-grip camera
        out of the window and said he had got
        pictures of the balloon.

        As he neared Cape Canaveral Commander
        Carpenter reported that his
        condition remained good, and medical
        data received here showed that his
        blood pressure, which had crept up
        a little, had gone down.---Reuter and

        THE only British component
        in the Aurora 7 space
        craft, which carried astronaut
        Scott Carpenter three
        times round the earth
        yesterday, played a vital
        part in his rescue.

        It was a tiny rescue radio
        transmitter, installed to give
        his position if he "ditched"
        far from waiting ships.

        The transmitter, called
        Sarah, is made by a London
        firm---Ultra Electronics, of
        Acton.

        "The system consists of
        miniature radio receivers
        and batteries carried in the
        space suit or inflated jacket,
        and a miniature receiver,"
        said a company spokesman.

        "Directional aerials can reach
        the signals from the transmitter
        at 60-miles range."

        ## Dinghy tests

        The man whose name is on
        the patent of Sarah is 41-year-old
        bachelor David
        Kerr, one of the engineering
        team which produced it.
        He tested it in a dinghy in
        Norwegian fiords.

        The Sarah sets cost between
        £80 and £100. Batteries
        cost between £15 and £20.
        And the receivers which can
        pick up signals from any
        transmitter can be fitted for
        under £1,000.

        Official American reaction
        last night: "It took us to
        the exact spot --- almost
        miraculous."

        ## BALLOON IN SPACE

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Sunday.

        Another communications satellite,
        a space balloon 135ft in diameter, will
        be tried out at Cape Canaveral this
        week. It will be sent 950 miles above
        the Atlantic before dropping back into
        the atmosphere, where it will burn up
        from friction.

        ## RADIATION TEST

        Two monkeys and four hamsters,
        drifting by balloon high over Canada,
        are due to be recovered by plane in
        the Edmonton area of Alberta to-day.
        The balloon was launched from Goose
        Bay, Labrador, to test the effects of

        ## ANIMALS DEAD IN SPACE CAPSULES

        PRINCE ALBERT, Saskatchewan,
        Monday.

        Two rhesus monkeys, four hamsters
        and a swarm of beetles in
        capsules were dead after a two-day
        high altitude research flight
        over Canada. The capsules were
        released by parachute last night
        from a balloon which carried them
        from Labrador to Saskatchewan.

        A spokesman said the animals'
        death was caused by failure of the
        "life support" system in the capsules.
        This included air conditioning,
        temperature and oxygen.---Reuter,

        # U.S. BALLOON GOES 922 MILES INTO SPACE

        ## INFLATED AFTER ROCKET LAUNCH

        ## COMMUNICATION SYSTEM TEST

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        NEW YORK, Wednesday.

        THE largest man-made
        object to be sent into
        space, a balloon 135ft in diameter,
        as tall as a 13-storey
        building, went 922 miles high
        after being launched to-day by
        a Thor rocket from Cape
        Canaveral.

        The balloon, known as "Big
        Shot" is the forerunner of a similar
        sphere which will be put into
        orbit as a communications satellite
        in the autumn.

        Big Shot's task to-day was to
        prove to American scientists that
        the gigantic balloon would inflate
        at the prescribed height and hold
        its shape. At Cape Canaveral
        technicians watched the brief life
        of Big Shot through a television
        camera mounted in the nose of the
        Thor rocket.

        ## AUTOMATIC RELEASE

        ## Puff of smoke

        After being released from its
        canister, the deflated plastic bundle
        took 20 seconds to become a huge
        ball 135 feet in diameter. It went
        into a suborbital flight, which
        ended 23 minutes later in a puff
        of smoke, as intended.

        Officials of the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration
        said the flight was a complete success.
        Big Shot's successor will be
        Echo Two, which will be put into
        orbit, joining Echo One, the communications
        satellite launched by
        the United States two years ago.

        American scientists are experimenting
        with various types of
        satellites to determine which would
        be the most feasible

        ## CLEARLY VISIBLE

        ## 1960 Launching

        OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
        writes: Echo One was fired into
        orbit in August, 1960, and is still
        reasonably spherical and clearly
        visible. It was originally 100ft in
        diameter, although buffetings by
        the particles in space must have
        shrunk this diameter to a certain
        extent.

        The satellite has had many
        signals bounced off it, for it is a
        passive reflector and contains no
        radio equipment.

        # A 13-storey balloon soars into space

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida,
        Wednesday. --- "Big Shot"
        rocketed into space from
        here today as a forerunner
        of an advanced communications
        satellite.

        "Big Shot," the largest
        object to go aloft, is a balloon
        and it inflated to the height
        of a 13-storey building.

        Successfully it soared 950
        miles above the Atlantic,
        providing a spectacular show
        for ground observers as it
        separated from a Thor
        booster and expanded to its
        135ft. diameter.

        After rising to 950 miles,
        510lb. "Big Shot" plunged
        back to the earth's atmosphere
        and burned up---as
        intended.

        A television camera mounted
        in the head of the Thor Rocket
        sent "live" pictures of the
        balloon inflation to a monitor
        on the Sape. Officials reported
        they were of excellent quality.

        Recovery craft waited about
        250 miles northeast of San
        Salvador to try to pick them
        up.---AP.

        ## MIDDLE EAST "RACE"

        From Our Own Correspondent
        JERUSALEM, Israel, Sunday.

        Israeli newspapers, saying that a
        rocket race in the Middle East has
        now started, urge the Government
        to proceed with the development of
        Israel's solid fuel rocket launched
        last year. They stress that Egypt's
        rockets, even without nuclear warheads,
        could seriously affect
        Israelis' morale in time of war.

        Egypt's Russian Tupolev
        bombers are considered for the
        moment more dangerous than
        the rockets. They could stage near-saturation
        raids over Israeli cities.

        The newspapers say that President
        Nasser leaves Israel no choice
        but to press forward with the development
        of means of defence.

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---The National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) has disclosed
        it expects to ask Congress next
        January for money to build a
        three-man spaceship for voyages
        around the moon in the next 10
        years.

        NASA also told about an unmanned
        "mobile laboratory" it
        hoped to dispatch to the moon
        aboard a Saturn rocket. This robot
        vehicle, a forerunner of human explorers,
        would creep over as much
        as 8,000 square miles of lunar terrain
        and report to earth what it
        found out.

        The vision of the 1960 was unfolded
        to 1,300 government, industry
        and university officials in the
        final day of a two-day meeting
        behind closed doors. Censored reports
        were made public.

        ## Astronaut Next Year

        The "advance manned spacecraft"
        to be proposed would be
        the next step after Project Mercury.
        NASA plans to boost a Mercury
        Astronaut into a 120-mile orbit
        some time next year and bring
        him back to earth after three circuits.

        The more spacious new three-man
        ship, boosted by the 1.5 million
        pound thrust Saturn, would
        be for flights around the moon
        and would double as an earth-orbiting
        laboratory.

        George M. Low, chief of NASA's
        space flight programs, said tentative
        plans called for putting the
        new ship under contract in the fiscal
        year starting next July 1.

        The project is called Apollo.

        ## Earth Orbits in 1966

        Research and development and
        prototype flights would take until
        1965. Earth orbiting with three-man
        crews conceivably could start
        in 1966 and moon orbits would follow
        as soon as technical and medical
        knowledge permitted, Low said.

        The Apollo would be the first
        civilian vehicle permitting man to
        "perform useful functions in
        space."

        Low said circumlunar flight was
        the "ultimate manned mission"
        foreseen in this decade with presently
        planned rocket boosters. But
        the Apollo vehicle will lead the
        way to landings on the moon and
        planets after 1970.

        ## Planetary Probings

        In its briefings NASA laid heavy
        emphasis on moon exploration but
        also told of ambitious plans to
        probe into the vicinity of Mars and
        Venus, and even Mercury and Jupiter.

        Edgar M. Cortright, head of
        lunar and planetary programs, said
        two attempts will be made this
        year to put unmanned vehicles in
        orbit around the moon.

        In the middle of the decade,
        NASA plans to land research instruments
        gently on the moon---first
        stationary types, then a mobile
        "creeping" laboratory, called
        Prospector, which will make remotely
        controlled explorations.

        Toward 1970, the agency hopes
        to send an ingenious device to the
        moon that can scoop up a surface
        sample and bring it home.

        # U.S. DILEMMA: 18 ORBITS?

        By PETER FAIRLEY

        America's manned space
        flight programme will
        now take a short breather
        while her space chiefs take
        the difficult decision: Should
        they try next for another
        three, seven or 18 orbits?

        The next astronaut is
        unlikely to go up before
        August because the Atlas
        rocket pads at Cape
        Canaveral are booked fully
        for jobs which include sending
        a spacecraft to Venus.

        Anything over three orbits
        will call for modification to
        the Mercury spaceship.
        Room must be found for a
        larger air conditioning unit
        and extra fuel for the
        hydrogen peroxide jets.

        ## More ambitious

        As a major overhaul must now
        be carried out on the capsule's
        attitude conrtol system---it went
        wrong on both orbital flights---this
        would seem a good moment
        to plump for a more ambitious
        shot next time.

        National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration officials
        are anxious to "blood" all seven
        astronauts as soon as possible
        and to give Alan Shepard and
        Virgil Grissom a second "go."

        These two---who made "sub-orbital"
        flights---are in danger
        of being written off in the publice
        image as the "not-quite
        spacemen," despite the fact that
        they took the same risks.

        Scott Carpenter's flight
        yesterday has proved two things
        clearly and confirmed some
        more.

        ## The armada

        The first is the wisdom of
        maintaining a massive and
        costly armada of recovery ships
        and airplanes. Even the 15,000
        men used yesterday proved
        barely adequate: the astronaut
        might have been lying severely
        injured during his 52 "lost"
        minutes.

        It showed that for the recovery
        of Moonships---which are likely
        to miss their planned landing
        areas not by hundreds but
        thousands of miles---a truly
        world-wide force will be needed.
        This is obviously one of the most
        promising areas for co-operation
        between Russia and the United
        States.

        Secondly, Carpenter's dramatic
        re-entry exposed the need for improved
        radio systems for spaceships.
        Something which will
        work during the fierce heat of
        re-entry is urgently required, particularly
        for Moonships which
        will come in at speeds up to
        25,000 m.p.h.

        ## Man is best

        The 37-year-old navy test pilot
        confirmed what was felt after
        the Glenn flight---that Man is
        infinitely better than a robot in
        space. Once again, it was only
        the ability of the pilot to take
        over manual control of his
        "ship" that enabled the full
        mission to be achieved.

        Reams of magnetic tape and
        recordings of Carpenter's
        physical and mental behaviour
        are now being analysed.

        These should indicate how the
        next astronauts are likely to
        stand up to the strain of longer
        flights.

        Both Glenn and Carpenter
        were tired out after four and
        three-quarter hours. But this
        was chiefly because they got too
        warm and had to take the
        controls for long stretches.

        Things should be better for
        men who can stay up long
        enough to take a catnap.

        ## Secret Satellite Launched by Air Force

        VANDENBERG AFB, Calif.
        (UPI) --- The Air Force has
        launched another secret satellite---probably
        one of the Discoverer
        series---but declined to say whether
        it had gone into orbit.

        The Air Force followed a pattern
        adopted two months ago of releasing
        a brief announcement describing
        the booster and second stage.
        The United State has recently refused
        to release any details on
        military satellities, including the
        reconnaissance type---Midas and
        Samos---or the Discoverers.

        # AID FOR SPACE SCIENTISTS

        THE combination of a 24in
        telescope and a television
        system is giving American space
        scientists their best pictures so far
        of rocket launchings . . . and of
        the Moon's features. The "television
        telescope," which is at
        Patrick Air Force Base, Florida,
        can distinguish an object the size
        of a football at 100 miles range.
        The television system gives less
        distortion than conventional pictures
        taken with the fastest film.

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP) [...]
        television telescope powerful
        enough to spot a bowling ball in
        orbit 100 miles high is now watching
        missiles and satellites fired from
        this rocket center, the Air Force
        announced.

        It consists of a 24-inch aperture
        astronomical telescope using a TV
        image orthicon system rather than
        conventional photographic recording.
        TV is used because the image
        tube is thousands of times more
        sensitive than the fastest photographic
        emulsions.

        ## Less Motion

        This permits shorter exposures,
        with less image motion caused
        by turbulence of the atmosphere
        and therefore there is less distortion
        in the picture, the Air Force
        reported.

        THE latest and strangest sight
        to be seen on the Cape Canaveral
        missile launching range is
        a new type of "space suit"
        designed for the men who fuel
        Titan II rockets.

        Special safety suits had to be
        devised because the fuels used
        are toxic. The green suits, the
        first of their kind ever devised
        for earthmen, are called SCAPE,
        standing for Self-Contained
        Atmospheric Protective Ensemble.
        They are very light, weighing
        only five lb., and extremely
        flexible.

        # 2 Contracts Let For Missile Work

        WASHINGTON (Special) --- The
        Army has awarded two new missile
        system contracts totaling more
        than $9.2 million.

        General Dynamics-Pomona Division
        of Pomona, Calif., was awarded
        a $7,779,600 contract for continuation
        of work on the Mauler missile
        system. Work will be done at
        Pomona, a labor surplus area.

        Stanford Research Institute of
        Menlo Park, Calif., was given a
        $1,493,247 contract for work on the
        wake radar system. This is a study
        of low frequency radar phenomena
        during the flight of missiles. The
        award was made by the San Francisco
        Ordnance District at Oakland,
        Calif., for the Army's Advanced
        Research Projects Agency.

        # Missile Workers Dispute Settled

        CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI)---About
        200 Atlantic missile range
        technicians have settled a six-month-old
        dispute with the Radio
        Corporation of America (RCA) in
        time for this country's next
        manned orbital flight. The employes,
        stationed here and at other
        points on the missile test range,
        are primarily involved in tracking
        test rockets and satellites.

        Federal Mediation and Conciliation
        Commissioner John R. Morgan
        of Washington said his proposed
        settlement was accepted by
        RCA officials and union leaders
        and will soon be put up to a union
        vote for ratification. Details of the
        settlement---arranged last Saturday---were

        # AF Sends Minuteman On 3,600-Mile Flight

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)---Preceded
        by a huge fireball, a
        Minuteman missile thundered out
        of an underground silo here and
        propelled its warhead 3,600 miles
        on a successful test flight.

        Earlier Friday, a Nike smoke
        rocket darted nearly 12 miles high
        in the first of 80 launchings planned
        in a year-long program to
        chart wind patterns above Cape
        Canaveral.

        The Nike studies are expected to
        help engineers design future space
        rockets, determining where they
        should be beefed up against high
        altitude cross winds and where
        they can be scaled down to save
        weight.

        As the intercontinental range
        Minuteman ignited near the base
        of the 85-foot pit, sheets of flame
        shot more than 100 feet into the
        air. Seconds later, the rocket
        speared through the flames, pitched
        quickly toward the southeast and
        sped from sight.

        The Air Force announced the success,
        11th in 14 launchings for
        Minuteman, which is scheduled to
        become operational late this year.

        The Defense Department plans
        to plant hundreds of the solid-fuel
        missiles in concrete- and steel-lined
        holes like that employed in Friday's
        test. In case of attack, they can be
        launched almost instantly.

        The Minuteman carried a new
        data gathering system tested successfully
        for the first time last
        week. The system, which radios via
        352 channels information from all
        three stages of the missile, is expected
        to reduce the number of
        test firings in the program.

        # £15m Goes Up . . . The Telescope

        THIS is the radio-telescope that
        never will be. Despite that,
        it is the most expensive one
        there has ever been.

        For the past four years the
        Americans have been building the
        telescope, at Sugar Grove, West
        Virginia, the dish of which would
        have had over twice the diameter
        of the one at Jodrell Bank, and so
        far they have spent almost £15m.
        on it.

        Now the United States Government
        has ordered that the work
        should be stopped, and what would
        have been the world's largest steerable
        telescope now will not be. The
        American Defence Department
        does not know how much of the
        money already spent will be
        recovered.

        However it will certainly save
        the remaining £57m, which the
        telescope was going to cost before
        it was completed. Even the original
        estimate of £28m was big enough.
        But since 1958 that estimate has
        jumped to £71m.

        It is noteworthy to place these
        figures by the side of those for
        Jodrell Bank. The British telescope
        has a dish diameter of 250ft (as
        against 600ft for Sugar Grove), and
        the original cost estimate was
        about £400,000.

        This estimate also rose, and
        there was a considerable hullaballoo
        when it did, but it rose to
        some £800,000.

        This is very small beer, indeed,
        when set beside the American
        figures. Sugar Grove, even before
        it was cancelled, had cost 18 times
        as much as Jodrell Bank did by the
        time it was completed.

        WASHINGTON (AP) --- A coin-sized
        pellet fired 200 miles into
        the sky plunged back into the atmosphere
        at 32,000 miles an hour,
        the U.S space agency said.

        This apparently was the "highest
        reentry velocity ever achieved by
        a man-made object," the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        said.

        The fiery tail was so intense, in
        spite of the object's minute size,
        that it was seen over a wide area.

        The tiny "payload" was launched
        from Wallops Island, Va.

        The man-made meteoroid was in
        the nose of a six-stage Trailblazer
        rocket.

        Two rocket stages fired upwards
        to send the tiny object to an altitude
        of 200 miles. Then the four
        other stages fired downwards successively
        to simulate reentry of a
        space body.

        # Defense Dept. Denies Study of New Space Plan

        WASHINGTON (AP) --- The Defense
        Department has denied it
        decided the Air Force should develop
        the technology for a manned
        satellite capable of inspecting and
        destroying an enemy space vehicle.

        At the same time, a Pentagon
        spokesman said "I don't know of
        any" six-month study to draft an
        enlarged military space program.

        He issued the denials in response
        to questions about a New York
        Times dispatch which said the
        Defense Department is embarking
        on a man-in-space program to prevent
        military control of space by
        the Soviet Union.

        # 'Superballoon' Sails Record 3,600 Miles

        HONOLULU (UPI) --- A 34-foot
        superpressure balloon, sent aloft to
        gather high altitude data, completed
        a record-breaking 19-day
        flight 3,600 miles west of Hawaii,
        Hickam Air Force Base announced.

        The balloon, one in a series of
        development test flights being
        conducted by scientists of the Air
        Force Cambridge Research Laboratory,
        was launched from Kindley
        Air Force Base in Bermuda
        May 31.

        The balloon's payload consisted
        of performance monitoring instruments
        to measure the temperatures
        and pressure of lifting gas and air,
        the altitude, a data coder and
        transmitter and a radio command
        receiver.

        In traveling 9,300 miles in 19
        days, the balloon exceeded the 10-day
        flight recorded by another
        balloon in the same test series last
        month.

        # AF Lofts Atlas, Receives Titan II At Calif. Station

        VANDENBERG AIR FORCE
        BASE, Calif. (UPI)---The Air Force
        has successfully fired an Atlas
        long-range missile, and at the same
        time reported arrival of the first
        Titan II intercontinental ballistic
        missile assigned to this base.

        The Atlas shot---which traveled
        down the Pacific missile range---was
        made from a semi-hard emplacement
        in an operational exercise
        by a 13-man Strategic Air
        Command crew. On a test witnessed
        by President Kennedy last March,
        an Atlas traveled 5,000 miles to
        within less than a mile of target.

        The Air Force also reported a
        103-foot, two-stage Titan II rocket
        was flown here aboard a C133 cargo
        plane from the Martin Co. plant at
        Denver. It will be used to test the
        silo facility and ground equipment,
        the Air Force said.

        The Titan II Silo complex was
        used last year in launching of a
        modified Titan I, but thus far no
        Titan II has been fired from this
        base, 160 miles north of Los Angeles.

        Upon completion of the tests, an
        operational prototype Titan II will
        be launched later this year from
        the 155-foot silo.

        The 6595th Aerospace Test Wing,
        commanded by Col Joseph J. Cody
        Jr., will direct the Titan II program
        here.

        The crew launching the Atlas
        was from SAC's 564th Strategic
        Squadron.

        # Flights Past Mars, Venus To Be Studied

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- The
        space agency plans soon to let a
        couple of small contracts to study
        the feasibility of sending men on
        a year-long flight past Mars and
        Venus sometime in the early
        1970s.

        Informed sources emphasized
        that there is no project for manned
        reconnaissance of Earth's nearest
        planetary neighbors.

        Purpose of the studies, it was
        said, is to supply the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) with a "conceptualization"
        of what such a project
        would entail if it ever is formally
        adopted.

        It was understood that NASA
        will pick the Ford Motor Co.'s
        Aeroneutronics Division and the
        Lockheed Missile and Space Co.
        to make six-month feasibility studies.
        After reports are in, one of
        the companies may be asked to
        continue the study for another six
        months or a year.

        ## Instruments First

        Long before sending men to the
        vicinity of Mars and Venus, NASA
        plans to reconnoiter both planets
        thoroughly with instruments
        aboard unmanned spacecraft.

        But if the Apollo project to send
        three-men teams to the moon and
        back in the late 1960s is successful,
        planetary expeditions are expected
        to follow.

        The Mars-Venus fly-by studies
        will go into such matters as rocket
        power, spacecraft shielding, "life
        support" equipment and supplies,
        recovery on return to Earth and
        cost.

        This is the way preliminary ideas
        appear to be shaping up:

        The flight would be attempted
        in 1971 or 1972 at a time when
        Mars and Venus were in positions,
        relative to the Earth, which would
        make it possible for a spaceship
        in an elliptical orbit to brush past
        both in one trip.

        A year after takeoff, having
        flown past both planets, the astronauts
        would find themselves back
        at their starting point, the Earth.

        # Senate Group OK's 'Private' Signal Satellite

        WASHINGTON (AP)---The Senate
        Commerce Committee has approved
        by a 15-2 vote a bill providing
        for private ownership of the
        U.S. portion of a global satellite
        communications system.

        In its principal provisions, the
        measure is similar to one passed
        by the House May 3 by 354-9 vote.

        The bill provides for the creation
        of a corporation to own and
        operate a commercial system of
        worldwide communications by
        bouncing electronic signals off the
        satellites.

        Half of the corporation's stock
        would be reserved for communications
        companies, and half would
        be offered to the public. The offering
        price of the shares could not
        be more than $100.

        When the measure is called up
        for action in the Senate, possibly
        in two weeks or so, a public-vs-private
        ownership fight is in prospect.

        ## Kennedy's Urging

        President Kennedy urged Congress
        to provide for private ownership,
        under government regulation,
        but Sen. Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn.,
        Wayne Morse, D-Ore., and others
        have vowed to battle for a government
        ownership bill they have introduced.

        Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, D-Wash.,
        the Commerce Committee
        chairman, said Sens. E. L. Bartlett,
        D-Alaska, and Ralph Yarborough,
        D-Tex., who cast the two
        dissenting votes, had been given
        10 days to file a minority report
        on the committee's recommendations.

        The committee's bill differs from
        the House measure with respect
        to the ownership of ground stations
        for sending and receiving signals
        from the communications satellites.

        Under the Senate measure, the
        Federal Communications Commission
        (FCC) would be directed to
        decide in the public interests
        whether the ground stations
        should be built and operated by
        the satellite corporation or by individual
        communications companies
        "without preference to either."

        The House bill directed the FCC
        to encourage ownership by communications
        companies.

        # Shepard Gets Honor Degree

        HANOVER, N.H. (AP) --- Dartmouth
        College awarded an honorary
        degree to astronaut Alan B.
        Shepard Jr., naming him "the
        American Christopher Columbus of
        space exploration."

        Bachelor of arts degrees were
        conferred on 606 seniors at the
        193-year-old college.

        Shepard, who was given an honorary
        master of arts degree, was
        born and spent his childhood in
        Derry, N.H., where his parents
        still reside. He returned to New
        Hampshire Friday, making his first
        visit since the historic suborbital
        flight May 5, 1961, that made him
        America's first man in space.

        Dartmouth said his exploit "was
        heroic because it was the kind of
        bravery that matters greatly. It
        was bravery with skill that gave
        new relevance to knowledge and
        opened unimagined realms as the
        reward of effort."

        "Dartmouth is privileged to acknowledge
        such a mastery of both
        self and of unique tasks. . . ."

        # 17-Orbit Shot Next Project For Spacemen

        HOUSTON (UPI) --- The director
        of manned space flights for the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration (NASA) says the
        agency plans no more three-orbit
        flights.

        The next planned mission is a
        day-long, 17-orbit shot set for early
        next year, he said.

        D. Brainerd Holmes said here
        that four capsules, similar to the
        three-orbit capsules but with capacity
        for more fuel and oxygen
        and refined equipment, are currently
        being built for the 17-orbit
        mission.

        # Sen. Case Says Army Will Close N.J. Missile Base

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Sen.
        Clifford P. Case, R-N.J., said that
        the Army plans to close its Nike-Ajax
        missile base near Summit,
        N.J., by October.

        However, the senator said it was
        still not clear whether the 65-acre
        tract on which the base is located
        would be given back to the Union
        County park systems.

        Case checked into the status of
        the base in response to a query
        from Rudolph Kirestan, general
        superintendent of the Union County
        Park Commission.

        An aide to the senator said an
        Army spokesman informed him
        about the impending shutdown,
        evidently because of a change in
        emphasis in defense concepts.

        He said the Army could not say
        at this time whether it would
        retain the land and use it for
        another defense facility.

        # Mercury Capsule Parachute Test Called Success

        HOUSTON (AP) --- A full-scale
        model of the Mercury space capsule
        used by America's astronauts
        was successfully parachuted into
        Trinity Bay here.

        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration Manned Space
        Craft Center crews directed the
        operation, designed to improve the
        parachute system of the capsule.
        Officials labeled the drop a success.

        Spokesmen said a model of the
        improved Mercury capsule will be
        dropped in abut 20 days and the
        remodeled capsule itself will be
        tested in about a month.

        The new capsule will use tetro
        rockets to lessen the impact. Current
        capsules use a parachute system.

        # First Pershing Missile Unit To Be Organized This Month

        WASHINGTON (AP)---The Army
        will organize its first unit to use
        the Pershing battlefield nuclear
        missile by the end of this month.

        It announced that the 2nd Missile
        Bn of the 44th Arty, with a
        manpower strength of 615 will be
        formed at Ft. Sill, Okla. Some personnel
        already have been in training
        at Orlando, Fla., and Ft. Sill.

        The battalion will have four batteries,
        each battery with one
        launcher and equipment needed to
        prepare and fire the 200-mile-plus
        missile.

        The Pershing is a solid fuel,
        quick-firing missile, designed as a
        replacement for the present liquid
        fuel Redstone.

        It can be transported on lightweight,
        tracked vehicles or airlifted
        by helicopter or in cargo
        planes. The prime contractor for
        the Pershing is the Martin Co.

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)---A
        Pershing missile lost thrust during
        second stage flight and fell
        into the Atlantic Ocean short of its
        intended goal of more than 150
        miles.

        It was the seventh failure in 38
        Pershing test firings.

        one of Hitler's main weapons in
        the "Blitz" on London during the
        last war, will be one of the exhibits
        in a new space and rocket
        section of the German museum
        here.

        The museum announced that negotiations
        are in progress for
        transfer of exhibits, including the
        V2 rocket, from Stuttgart where
        they have been stored since an
        unsuccessful attempt to found a
        space museum there in 1953.

        # Six AF Academy Cadets to Test Space Endurance

        COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.
        (UPI) --- The Air Force Academy
        said six cadets have been chosen
        to spend 15 days testing their endurance
        under simulated space
        flight conditions in an experiment
        which could lead to their selection
        as astronauts.

        The test will be undertaken at
        Marietta, Ga., by the Human Factors
        Research Department of Lockheed-Georgia
        Co.

        The cadets will live under conditions
        similar to a 15-day space
        flight, with the noise of a missile
        in flight piped in.

        The cadets are Robert Lee Staib
        of Chicago; Richard Slowik of
        Belleville, Mich.; Phillip F. Patterson
        of Richmond, Mo.; Larry
        D. Springs of Fresno, Calif.;
        Rupert G. Fisk of Anchorage,
        Alaska, and Burnham A. Hawthorne
        of Danvers, Mass.

        They were chosen from among

        # Plan Drawn For Europe Space Probes

        PARIS (AP) --- Western Europe
        has taken a giant step toward
        establishing its own space program.

        A dozen nations agreed on a
        plan calling for rocket probes,
        satellites and a lunar probe over
        the next eight years. Under the
        program, atmosphere-testing rockets
        will be launched from European
        pads next year. A small satellite
        will be put into orbit by 1967
        and a large satellite will be sent
        up in 1969.

        Representatives of the countries
        agreed on the text of the agreement
        which forms the European
        Space Research Organization.

        The countries participating are
        France, Britain, West Germany,
        Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium,
        Switzerland, Austria, Denmark,
        Sweden and Norway.

        ## $300 Million Budget

        The program has a $300 million
        budget for the first eight years.

        During the first eight years, the
        program calls for launching 440
        rocket probes, 22 small satellites,
        8 lunar rocket probes and several
        large satellites.

        A spokesman for the program
        said that all the rocketry needed
        will be made in Europe.

        Headquarters for the program
        will be set up in Delft, Holland.
        The rocketry will be assembled at
        a research center in Darmstadt,
        Germany. Laboratories will be set
        up in many of the participating
        countries.

        One of the program's first
        launching sites will be in Sweden
        about 90 miles from Narvik, Norway.

        # 30 Hurt in Blast At Titan Missile Site in Arizona

        RILLITO, Ariz. (AP) --- Officials
        said at least 30 men were injured
        in an explosion at a Titan missile
        site near this southeastern Arizona
        community.

        An undetermined number of
        workers were reported in the silo
        when the explosion occurred.

        Titan officials said the explosion
        was caused by an electrical short,
        and that there was a great amount
        of smoke but apparently no fire in
        the silo.

        Officials said the explosion occurred
        while they were making a
        heat and ventilation test in the
        silo.

        Twenty men were rushed to hospital,
        authorities said.

        # Saturn Gets 'Spacy Look'

        HUNTSVILLE Ala. (AP) --- The
        Saturn booster rocket --- currently
        the free world's largest operating
        space vehicle --- is getting a new
        look.

        Something engineers refer to as
        "spacy-looking" tail fins are being
        added to the huge rocket. It is one
        of several design changes being
        incorporated in a version of the
        Saturn to be used on the vehicle's
        fifth flight.

        So far two of the Saturn boosters
        have been flown in a testing program.

        Design changes are being previewed
        by engineers at the Marshall
        Space Flight Center, where
        the Saturn is being developed. Full-scale
        models are being constructed
        of the Saturn booster's tail section,
        forward section, test stand equipment
        and launch hold-down arms.

        # Vandenberg NCO Gets SAC Honor

        OMAHA, Neb. (Special)---S M
        Sgt Robert A. Gillham of the 1st
        Strategic Aerospace Div, Vandenberg
        AFB, Calif., has been named
        the Strategic Air Comd's outstanding
        airman of the year. He will
        represent SAC at the Air Force
        Association convention at Las Vegas
        in September.

        His selection, made here by a
        committee of officers, followed a
        review of the eight nominees from
        SAC's major subcommands. In announcing
        the winner, the board
        also stated that the competition
        was "very close," and that "any
        one of the nominees would have
        made an outstanding representative
        of the command."

        Gillham, who is NCOIC of 1st
        Strat AD's missile safety operations
        division, has actively participated
        in more than 300 hazardous
        missile test operations and 53
        launches of ballistic missiles at
        Vandenberg, officials said.

        # 41% of U.S. Space Funds To Be Spent in South

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Forty-one
        cents of every dollar the
        United States spends next year in
        its effort to beat Russia in the
        space race will be spent in the
        South.

        No other section of the country
        will benefit more on a dollar and
        cents basis from the multibillion
        dollar space program.

        And only one state --- California
        --- ranks ahead of the South's
        three space giants --- Florida,
        Louisiana, and Alabama --- in the
        amount of money to be spent on
        construction, research and development,
        and salaries.

        Only South Carolina among the
        southern states will not share in
        the bounty.

        The estimated distribution of
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration funds for fiscal
        1963 shows a blank for South
        Carolina as well as Idaho, Kansas,
        Maine, Nebraska, Nevada, North
        Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont
        and Wyoming.

        NASA expects to spend $3.78 billion
        during fiscal 1963, of which
        $1.56 billion will be spent in nine
        southern states. During the fiscal
        year now coming to a close, NASA
        spent $1.82 billion.

        California with the test site at
        Vandenberg Air Force Base and
        its numerous space-age industries
        will be the recipient of an estimated
        $947.76 million next year.

        Next on the list is Florida, jotted
        down for $543.26 million, which includes
        construction funds for
        launching sites for the moonbound
        Saturn rockets.

        For the third straight year
        Florida will receive the biggest
        amount for construction, a record
        $361.96 million.

        # Slayton Role Called 'Vital'

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Space
        chief James E. Webb said that astronaut
        Donald K. (Deke) Slayton
        is playing "a very vital role" regardless
        of whether he ever goes
        into orbit.

        Webb denied a reporter's suggestion
        at a news conference that
        "Deke's future seems pretty
        gloomy." But he left unaswered
        the question of whether Slayton
        will ever make a space trip.

        Slayton had been picked for the
        three-orbit flight which was made
        by Malcolm Scott Carpenter May
        24. Deke was grounded by the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        in March because of
        a fibrillation, an intermittent irregularity
        of heartbeat which the
        agency had known about since 1959.

        Last week the 38-year-old Air
        Force major went to Boston for
        an examination by Dr. Paul Dudley
        White, the famous heart specialist
        who attended President Eisenhower.

        ## No Report Yet

        Webb said White had not made
        his report "so far as I know." He
        said NASA had asked the doctor
        to contribute his skill and wisdom
        "in behalf of the United States"
        to help the agency decide "what
        we should do about this fine astronaut."

        Webb said the work done by astronauts
        on the ground during an
        orbital flight by one of their fellows
        was vital to the space program.

        He said "Slayton's judgment (on
        the ground) may be just as important"
        as the work of the man
        in the spacecraft.

        A reporter asked whether a favorable
        report by White would automatically
        mean Slayton would get
        a trip into space. Webb returned
        an emphatic "no."

        He said White's recommendations
        would affect but not dictate the
        decision.

        # Cosmonauts' Pupils May Orbit Next

        MOSCOW (AP)---Maj. Yuri Gagarin
        said here he and Maj. Gherman
        Titov, the Soviet Union's first
        cosmonauts, would probably be
        grounded until all their pupils
        have had rides in space.

        He did not indicate how long he
        and Titov might have to wait for
        their next flight.

        But the Soviet Union is believed
        to be training about 10 space pilot
        candidates.

        Gagarin made the remark in an
        interview he and Titov held with
        Soviet newsmen. Most of the press
        conference, as reported by the Soviet
        news agency Tass, appeared to
        have been devoted to denunciations
        of planned American nuclear tests
        in space.

        ## Tells of Disargreement

        Titov told the newsmen about
        his disagreement with American
        astronauts John Glenn and M. Scott
        Carpenter over what he called
        "luminous flies" they had seen during
        their flights.

        The Soviet cosmonaut said he
        thought the glowing spots seen
        through the spaceships' portholes
        were weightless drops of gas and
        fluid used to clean the rocket engines
        before takeoff that reflected
        the rays of the sun.

        Titov recently returned from a
        visit to the United States where he
        met American space pilots.

        # U.S. LAUNCHING PAD REPAIRS

        ## THOR DELAYS

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Friday.

        United States Defence Department
        and Atomic Energy Commission
        officials are discussing the
        technical necessity for another one
        or two high altitude bursts following
        yesterday's unsuccessful fourth
        test. The decision will be made
        by President Kennedy, balancing
        the technical and political considerations.

        The repair of the launching pad
        on which a Thor missile was blown
        up yesterday at Johnston Island in
        the Pacific will take two weeks to
        a month. It was the only one in
        the island.

        # FIRMS COLLABORATE

        The British Aircraft Corporation
        announced yesterday that an agreement
        had been signed with the
        French firm of Nord Aviation to
        collaborate in guided weapons.
        The French and British Governments
        support the move.

        Both companies will work
        together on design studies and
        weapon development. Development
        cost sharing will substantially
        reduce expenditure.

        Together the companies have
        much experience of tactical
        weapons requiring high mobility
        and rapid deployment. These
        include the S.S. 10 and S.S. 11,
        developed by Nord, and the Blue
        Water, Bloodhound, Vigilant and
        Thunderbird systems by British
        Aircraft.

        # Explosion Ruins First Centaur Try

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)---The
        maiden flight of the long-suffering
        Centaur space rocket ended abruptly
        Wednesday in a shattering explosion
        nearly 30,000 feet above the
        Atlantic Ocean.

        The blazing blowup of the $9
        million vehicle 55 seconds after it
        was launched was a severe setback
        to this nation's plan of developing
        Centaur as a workhorse booster
        to triple present U.S. space payload
        capability.

        It also could delay the forthcoming
        orbital flight of astronaut
        M. Scott Carpenter, set for May 17,
        if the trouble can be linked to the
        first-stage Atlas. Another Atlas of
        the same model is to be the
        booster for Carpenter.

        Officials indicated they thought
        the trouble was in the Atlas, but
        they said a thorough study must
        be made of radio and camera coverage
        of the flight to determine
        if the Atlas or the second stage
        broke apart.

        # Navy Studies Floating Pad For Missiles

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---The U.S.
        Navy, which recently established
        its first space satellite command,
        is considering a plan for an astronautic
        ship that could carry out
        sea launchings of the world's largest
        rockets, including America's
        20-story-high Saturn.

        The Bureau of Ships Journal said
        that such a ship, displacing about
        10,000 tons and accompanied when
        necessary by a floating drydock,
        would meet many if not all of the
        requirements for mobility in space
        operations.

        "What has never been done and
        what needs to be done in the
        Navy's astronautic program," it
        said, "is the design and construction
        of an integrated astronautics
        ship, combining a capability of all
        astronautics operations in a single
        seagoing, tactically useful platform."

        The article was first prepared for
        a tactical engineering journal by
        Lt Cmdr Burton I. Edelson of the
        bureau's Command Support Branch.

        ## Curtiss Recommended

        He said a seaplane tender such
        as the 508-foot-long Curtiss, which
        displaces 8,671 tons light and 13,475
        tons fully loaded, would be "ideally
        suited for an astronautics ship."

        The Curtiss, already modified for
        observation and research use by
        the Atomic Energy Commission, is
        in mothballs at San Diego, Calif.
        Its full complement is 1,195 men.

        Edelson said the astronautic ship
        could launch from her deck all of
        the present solid-fueled rockets, including
        the Minuteman intercontinental
        ballistic missile.

        For liquid-fueled vehicles such as
        the Saturn, described by the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        as the world's largest
        known rocket, he recommended
        floating drydocks.

        "A floating drydock can provide
        an excellent launch pad, reasonably
        mobile, and large enough to accommodate
        the very biggest boosters,
        even including Saturn," he said.

        "The ship, anchored in the vicinity,
        would provide needed support
        in terms of hotel accommodations,
        special power, shops, laboratories,
        range safety and tracking."

        # Orbiting Earth

        MOSCOW (UPI)---The Soviet
        Union has launched another unmanned
        earth satellite in its current
        series of tests leading toward
        putting a man on the moon, the
        news agency Tass announced.

        Tass said the new satellite, called
        Cosmos V, is circling the earth
        every 102.75 minutes between 120
        and 1,000 miles above the earth
        with "all systems functioning normally."

        Cosmos V's maximum distance
        from the earth is greater by some
        21 miles than any of the previous
        shots.

        Describing Cosmos V as "a routine
        artificial earth satellite," Tass
        said the new sputnik's orbit of inclination
        to the equator is 49 degrees,
        4 minutes.

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- The
        space junkyard is growing.

        In the 4½ years since the first
        sputnik went up, the United States
        and Russia have rocketed more
        than 340[?] objects into orbit.

        This assortment of satellites,
        probes, spent fuel tanks, and bits
        and pieces of rocket and spacecraft
        hardware weighed a total of
        about 300 tons.

        According to the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration
        (NASA), more than half of this
        man-fabricated material, consisting
        of at least 192 separate items, is
        still in orbit around the earth or
        sun.

        Except for a few scientific,
        weather, communications, and special-purpose
        military satellites
        whose radios are still working,
        these objects are what NASA officials
        call "space garbage."

        The inventory of junk in space
        would be much bigger if it were
        not for forces of man and nature
        which tend to check its growth.

        Some 150 satellites, rocket stages
        and metal scraps which once were
        in orbit have since "decayed." The
        bulk of them slowly spiraled down
        into the atmosphere and were
        burned up by air friction. A couple
        of spacecraft, Russia's Lunik
        II and America's Ranger IV,
        crashed into the moon and were
        destroyed.

        Considerably more than a score---including
        the cabins which carried
        cosmonauts Yuri A. Gagarin and
        Gherman S. Titov and astronauts
        John H. Glenn Jr. and Scott Carpenter
        into orbit --- were brought
        down by man and recovered.

        Not counting empty rockets and
        other junk, 39 satellites still are
        in orbit around the earth while
        another five are monotonously
        soaring in endless flight around
        the sun.

        The live solar satellites include
        three launched by the United
        States and two by Russia. Of the
        39 earth satellites 33 are American,
        five Russian, and one British-American.

        The Russians launched the first
        artificial satellite of the earth on
        Oct. 4, 1957. But the oldest man-made
        moonlet still in orbit is Explorer
        I, launched Jan. 31, 1958.
        This 30.8-pound object was the
        first American satellite.

        The oldest satellite still transmitting
        is the grapefruit-sized U.S.
        Vanguard I, put in orbit March 17,
        1958. Its sun-powered "beeple-beep"
        tracking signal may go on repeating
        itself for hundreds of years.

        In all 13 satellites, not including
        recently launched U.S. military
        spacecraft of the Discoverer, Samos,
        and Midas series, are still sending
        signals to earth. These include 11
        American craft, the U.S.-British
        international satellite, Ariel, and
        Russia's Cosmos 5.

        Ariel, an ionospheric experiment,
        was launched at Cape Canaveral
        April 26. Cosmos 5, described by
        Russia as a scientific satellite, was
        flung into the sky May 28.

        Among the still functioning U.S.
        earth satellites are the Tiros V
        weather eye, launched June 19, and
        Telstar, the 170-pound communications
        satellite launched July 10
        which bridged Europe and America
        via television for the first time
        in history.

        Here, based on NASA records,
        is the space box score:

        Successful satellite or deep space-probe
        launchings; U.S. 89, Russia
        21, U.S.-Britain 1.

        # Grissom Wins Space Trophy

        WASHINGTON (AP)---The first
        Gen Thomas D. White Space Trophy
        was presented here to the Air
        Force's space pioneer, Astronaut
        Virgil I. (Gus) Grissom.

        Secretary of the Air Force Eugene
        M. Zuckert made the formal

        WASHINGTON (AP)---The United
        States and Italy have concluded
        preliminary discussions on a joint
        space project which will provide
        the scientific world with its first
        satellite moving on the equatorial
        orbit.

        A spokesman for the U.S. National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) said
        that what he called a memorandum
        of understanding has been drafted
        and will now be referred to the
        State Department on the one hand,
        and to the Italian Foreign Ministry,
        on the other.

        According to the agreement
        reached, the United States will provide
        the rocket booster and Italy,
        the platform and the satellite itself,
        the NASA spokesman said.

        ## Can Float

        The platform, he said, could float
        or be anchored to the bottom of
        the Indian Ocean somewhere off
        the shore of Africa on the equator.

        The spokesman called the equatorial
        orbiting of the satellite of
        special scientific interest because
        there had been no opportunity before
        to make experiments with the
        equatorial orbit.

        # New Signal Satellite Pact Goes to Hughes

        WASHINGTON (AP)---The National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) awarded
        Hughes Aircraft Co. a $2.5-million
        contract to develop equipment for
        an advanced project communications
        satellite.

        The advanced satellite would appear
        to hang motionless at an altitude
        of 22,300 miles, staying in
        about the same position as it orbits
        at the same speed as the earth
        turns.

        The 55-pound vehicle would carry
        several wide-band radio signal
        repeaters, each capable or relaying
        several hundred telephone calls
        or one television channel.

        Hughes is working on a $4-million
        contract to build three small
        experimental communications satellites.

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Rep.
        James I. Fulton, R-Pa., has complained
        that the Atlas booster program
        at Cape Canaveral is producing
        far more failures than the
        California program.

        "Three out of four of the last
        launches at Canaveral have been
        unsuccessful," Fulton told the national
        space officials. "We should
        be beyond this stage. On the West
        Coast the Atlas moves at a much
        higher percentage of success."

        The Pennsylvania Republican
        questioned the officials at a session
        of the House Science and
        Astronautics Committee, of which
        he is a member.

        D. D. Wyatt, director of the
        space agency's office of programs,
        said he and his colleagues were
        trying to cut down failures. He
        testified that the Venus shot which
        failed last Saturday at Cape Canaveral
        cost the taxpayers from
        $12 to $14 million.

        Wyatt did not discuss Fulton's
        statement that more Florida shots
        fail than those from California.

        The West Coast program is carried
        on at Vandenberg Air Force
        Base.

        WASHINGTON (Special) --- The
        Air Force will make test soil borings
        in the vicinity of Carswell
        Air Force Base, Ft. Worth, Tex., as
        part of an analysis to determine
        possible locations for future Minuteman
        missiles.

        The tests, made in advance of
        specific authority for additional
        Minutemen missiles, saves valuable
        planning time in determining
        suitable locations for Minuteman
        complexes.

        Teams will conduct test soil borings
        and analyze such factors as
        adequacy of roads and suitability
        of topography. Test results are
        filed for use as additional missile
        sites are authorized for selection.

        Installations already selected to
        support the first five hardened
        and dispersed Minuteman wings
        are: Malmstrom AFB, Great Falls,
        Mont.; Ellsworth AFB, Rapid City,
        S.D.; Minot AFB, Minot, N.D.;
        Whiteman AFB, Knob Noster, Mo.;

        # AF Launches 3rd Satellite

        VANDENBERG AIR FORCE
        BASE, Calif. (UPI) --- The U.S.
        Air Force has launched its third
        secret satellite within six days,
        but has given no details.

        There was no word on whether
        the satellite achieved its intended
        polar orbit.

        The Air Force last Sunday fired
        an Atlas-Agena B vehicle with a
        possible reconnaissance satellite
        from Point Arguello, Calif.

        On Monday, another launch was
        announced---this of the same type
        as Friday's shot as far as the
        booster was concerned.

        The Air Force announcement
        said only, "A satellite employing a
        Thor-Agena B booster combination"
        was launched by the Air Force
        from Vandenberg. This is the same
        combination as used in the Discoverer
        series.

        ## Around America To-day

        # EMERGENCY SUPPLIES FOR MOON MEN

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENTS
        WASHINGTON, Monday.

        PLANS are being studied for
        a base camp on the moon
        with oxygen and other supplies
        for astronauts in case
        they are marooned there. The
        lunar storage depot would be
        mobile and able to move by
        remote control towards the
        astronauts.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration will let contracts
        within the next two or three
        weeks for a definitive six-month
        study of "unmanned support for
        the Apollo programme." The base
        camp plan would be one of the
        concepts involved.

        Present thinking is that spare
        food, water and oxygen would be
        loaded aboard heavy tracked
        vehicles known as lunar logistics
        carriers. Two or more would be
        "soft-landed" on the dusty lunar
        surface before the first manned
        expedition sets out.

        If anything should go wrong
        with the lunar space-craft and the
        astronauts found themselves unable
        to take off, from the moon,
        the unmanned supply vehicles
        would be sent. The intention
        would be to provide emergency
        succour until another manned expedition
        arrived to rescue the
        astronauts.

        # U.S. Astronauts May Take Space Stroll After '65

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Some
        time after 1965 an American astronaut
        may leave the confinement
        of his orbiting spacecraft for a
        ramble outside.

        This possibility was suggested in
        an interview by D. Brainerd
        Holmes, chief of the U. S. manned
        space flight program. He said, "We
        are doing studies" on how astronauts
        might function in space outside
        the protection of their spacecraft.

        He said he thought the first
        actual experiments might be conducted
        from a three-man Apollo
        cabin. Apollo is the project to land
        men on the moon and bring them
        back before 1970. The first Apollo
        training flights are scheduled for
        1965.

        Some space planners envision astronauts
        buzzing in and out of
        their orbital quarters --- making
        repairs, assembling observatories,
        or performing docking operations
        --- like hornets working around
        their nests.

        The first man to emerge from
        the airlock of a spaceship hurtling
        in orbit at nearly 5 miles a second
        will have to wear a pressure suit
        to keep him from exploding in the
        near vacuum outside his craft.

        If he takes his space walk by
        daylight, his suit will have to be
        coated with a light-reflecting material
        to keep him from cooking
        in the direct glare of the sun.

        Undoubtedly, he will be connected
        with his orbiting base by a
        lifeline to keep him from drifting
        off past hope of recovery. The line
        may include a tube to supply him
        with oxygen.

        He may carry on his shoulders a
        gas tank with a nozzle resembling
        a siphon bottle to enable him to
        move around. He may wear magnetic
        shoes to help him keep his
        footing on the spacecraft's metal
        shell.

        All these possibilities presumably
        will be thoroughly explored
        in the studies which Holmes said
        the National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration (NASA) is now
        making.

        Before shoving astronauts into

        A PLAN to launch an American "Commando in Space"---a
        man in a satellite who could, if needed, destroy a
        hostile Spacecraft---was revealed here today.

        This Space Patrol would be entirely defensive and would aim only at
        preventing Russia from gaining "military
        control" of Space, it was pointed out.

        After a report of this project was published,
        the United States Defence Department immediately
        denied that the Government was going to
        put military "teeth" into the Space programme,
        which is civilian-run.

        ## 'Leak'

        But the "Commando" story---published in the
        influential New York Times---is still regarded as
        an "official leak" of a major policy change.

        In a dispatch from Washington, the newspaper said
        the nation's Space programme "is set to acquire a
        military tinge. . . ."

        The dispatch went on: "As a result, the Defence
        Department has decided that the Air Force should
        develop the technology for a manned satellite capable of
        inspecting and destroying a hostile vehicle in Space."

        Later the Defence
        Department denied the
        "military tinge" report.

        A spokesman said the
        Space programme would
        continue as a civilian project
        under the direction of
        the Space Agency.

        It is no secret in Washington
        that America is
        about to change its attitude
        to Space activities.

        ## Private

        Vice-President Lyndon
        Johnson, chairman of the
        Space Agency, and Dr.
        Edward C. Welsh, executive
        secretary, have emphasised
        in private speeches
        and at committee meetings
        that Space programmes
        should embrace both civilian
        and military activities.

        As the story was first
        officially mentioned in today's
        issue of the New
        York Times---and sent out
        by all American news
        agencies---it is generally regarded
        as being "an
        official leak."

        President Kennedy and
        some previous Presidents
        have used this way of
        "trying out" public
        opinion.

        The method is to call in
        a trusted correspondent
        from the Times, and give
        him a report "not for attribution."

        ## Waits

        Then the Administration
        waits to hear public reaction---and
        usually the Press
        officers of the particular
        Department concerned
        deny any knowledge of the
        event.

        Nonetheless, a few weeks
        later it proves to be correct.

        The "official" denials
        from Government spokesmen
        today mean either
        that the men on duty have
        not been told, or that minor
        details may be inaccurate.

        But everybody in
        America belleves the essential
        facts remain and that
        America intends to have
        more aggressive astronauts---Spacemen
        capable of
        Commando-like operations
        high above the Earth.

        From DONALD LUDLOW,
        Washington, Monday

        A RUMPUS is boiling up over whether America
        is being too cautious in the race against
        Russia to the moon.

        The critics, who have the support of astronauts
        Glenn and Scott Carpenter, say American Space
        capsules are too complicated and overloaded with
        safety gadgets, and American astronauts are too
        old and over-trained.

        What, they ask, is the
        need for fifteen separate
        radio sets and a periscope
        weighing 300lb. when the
        astronaut can see all he
        needs from a simple porthole?

        Russian capsules are
        stripped to the bone, Russian
        cosmonauts are years
        younger than the American
        team. They are not
        so experienced as test
        pilots, but Space flying is
        a brand new art.

        ## Wasted

        Glenn and Scott Carpenter
        said they wasted
        hours training for emergencies
        that never arose.

        But they had to improvise
        to deal with those
        that DID happen.

        Another major issue is
        over the way the race to
        the moon should be run.

        A round trip is out of
        the question for years, but
        both American and Russian
        scientists agree that
        they can put men on the
        moon and take them off
        again.

        The moonship could be
        sent on its way from a
        mothership already orbiting
        the earth---or the moon
        itself.

        Such a launching would
        be safer in the Earth
        orbit, and this is the
        method now being worked
        on by the Americans.
        Launching a Moonship in
        the lunar orbit rules out
        all hope of rescue in case
        of mishap---but is easier
        to achieve.

        Typically, this is the
        method the Russians
        favour.

        Those in charge of the
        US moon project say
        that any tragedy caused
        by taking a risk might so
        shock public opinion it
        would set American Space
        exploration back years.

        * But I predict that
        when the controversy
        reaches President Kennedy
        he will speak out in
        favour of a few more
        risks.

        # NASA to Pick 5 to 10 New Astronauts in 62

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- The
        space agency said it is looking over
        more than 25 applications from
        persons who want to fly to the
        moon.

        From this list, after careful
        screening, the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration
        (NASA) next fall will pick a new
        crop of five to 10 astronauts to
        join the original seven.

        The applications were in response
        to an April 18 NASA announcement
        listing five basic qualifications.
        The application deadline
        was June 1.

        Of the total being studied, 53
        applications were supplied by the
        armed services after preliminary
        screening of a larger group of jet
        test pilots.

        ## 200 Applications

        More than 200 applications came
        from civilians. A NASA spokesman
        said this group, which included
        many persons obviously not qualified,
        will be cut to 15 or 20.

        He said the agency will "take a
        hard look" at about 70 applications
        in all, military and civilian, before
        whittling the list down further.

        Applicants left after preliminary
        screening will be interviewed and
        given written examinations next
        month on their engineering and
        scientific knowledge. Those still in
        the running after that will be given
        rigorous physical examinations by
        medical specialists.

        Selection of the new astronauts
        will be made, probably in September
        or October, by Robert R. Gilruth,
        director of NASA's Manned
        Spacecraft Center at Houston.

        ## Intensive Training

        They will be subjected to intensive
        training similar to that given
        the Mercury astronauts and join
        the present astronauts in the both
        --- Mercury Gemini and Apollo
        manned flight programs.

        In Gemini, astronauts will fly in
        two-man spacecraft in orbital
        flights around the earth lasting up
        to a week. In Apollo, the project
        to land men on the moon before
        1970, they will work out in three-man
        craft for up to two weeks.

        The first Gemini flights, which
        will include training in coupling
        spacecraft and rockets in orbit,
        will get under way late next year.
        The first Apollo training flights,
        in orbit around the earth, are expected
        in 1965.

        A NASA spokesman said Gemini
        pilots probably will be picked from
        the original seven astronauts, with
        members of the new group serving
        as co-pilots.

        ## Some to Leave

        Many of the pioneer group are
        expected to leave the manned
        flight program after Gemini, but
        some may continue on into Apollo,
        it was said.

        Some of the new astronauts,
        NASA said, may serve as spacecraft
        commanders on Apollo missions
        in the late stages of Apollo
        spacecraft development, the agency
        said, a third group of astronauts
        will be added to the pool.

        The astronauts to be picked next
        fall will average some years
        younger than the Mercury crew.
        The specifications and the new applicants
        must be under 35 at the
        time of selection.

        Applicants for the Mercury program
        were limited to military jet
        test pilots. NASA widened the field
        for the new selection by including
        civilian test pilots from government
        and industry.

        # West's Most Powerful Rocket Engine Passes First Full-Power Test

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) --- The giant F1 rocket
        engine, scheduled to power manned flights to the moon, was fired
        for the first time at full power here and for the full time period it
        would be used in flight.

        A National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman said
        the engine roared for about 2½ minutes at a thrust level of more
        than 1.5 million pounds.

        ## 300 Test Firings

        It is the most powerful rocket
        engine the Western world has developed
        to the advanced test-firing
        stage. It has been test-fired about
        300 times at less than full power
        levels.

        The F1 will be the power plant
        for the advanced Saturn vehicle,
        which will play a key role in lunar
        exploration for the United States.
        In that version, the engine will be
        mounted in a group of five, developing
        7.5 million pounds thrust
        in the first stage.

        ## Slated for Nova

        The same engine is also slated
        for use, in clusters, to drive the
        even larger Nova space vehicle
        now under development.

        NASA said three new test stands
        are being built at Edwards to test
        the F1 engine for flight acceptance
        starting in 1963. They are in
        addition to the present three test
        stands in use for research and
        development.

        BALTIMORE (AP)---An instructor with the Industrial College of
        the Armed Forces said at a national security seminar here that
        the United States has adopted a new concept of putting a man
        on the moon by 1970.

        The instructor, Air Force Col William N. Boaz Jr., said the former
        concept of launching a man directly to the moon's surface has
        been scrapped as too costly and requiring too much power.

        "Plans now call for a launch into moon orbit," he said. "Then
        a capsule carrying two men will be released for a moon landing
        while one man remains in the space ship in moon orbit."

        most powerful rocket motor ever
        to be tested, at least in the United
        States, will be test-fired June 9 by
        the Aerojet-General Corporation.

        The motor is a 100-inch, 700,000-pound
        thrust solid propellant
        motor, constructed for the U.S. Air
        Force by Aerojet.

        Reporting the forthcoming test,
        Aviation Daily said that the five-segment
        engine weighs about 175
        tons and is programmed to fire for
        two minutes.

        Aviation Daily said that a simulated
        Titan II engine will be
        mounted near the nozzle of the
        solid-fuel motor to simulate the
        environment of a Titan III, in
        which two 120-inch solids will be
        strapped to a Titan II.

        Liquid thrust vector control, using
        nitrogen tetroxide, will be used.

        A 50,000-pound thrust rocket will
        be used as igniter.

        The test will be held at Sacramento,
        Calif.

        RUSSIA last night ordered tests of her latest type
        of nuclear weapons and simultaneously indicated
        that she has successfully fired her first Polaris-type
        underwater missile.

        The Government said the
        tests were a "forced
        measure," made inevitable by
        recent American nuclear
        bomb explosions.

        The launching of the underwater
        missile was watched
        yesterday by Mr. Kruschev.

        It was followed by the
        award of the title Hero of
        the Soviet Union---Russia's
        V.C.---to three atomic submarine
        officers

        Russia has had rocket-armed
        submarines for three
        or four years but, until now,
        they have not been able to
        fire underwater.

        America already has hundreds
        of Polaris missiles
        with a range of more than
        1,500 miles, mounted in
        nuclear submarines.

        NEW PLANS---These drawings
        and models have been released
        in Washington by the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        to show how the U.S.
        plans to land explorers on the
        moon. Under the plan, a Saturn
        C5 rocket would place a package
        in orbit around the moon. While
        in orbit, the package would tip
        at an angle and drop a capsule
        containing two men. A third
        man continues in orbit in a service
        nodule coupled to a re-entry
        vehicle. After exploration, the
        two men blast off the moon and
        rejoin the service nodule for the
        return trip to earth. The photo
        at left above shows how the
        capsule-service nodule segments
        fit inside the rocket, while above,
        the landing unit is shown ready
        to drop off. At right, the landing
        unit blasts off, leaving its platform
        on the moon's surface. ---AP

        # GUNNERS' MANY ROLES IN WAR

        An Honest John missile roars skywards as the firing button is
        pressed by RSM L. G. Prewett, of the Army Information

        # Tactics & weapons demonstrated

        By Brig. W. F. K. THOMPSON,
        Daily Telegraph Military Correspondent

        IN the centenary year of the
        first appointment of
        "instructors in gunnery," the
        School of Artillery, Larkhill,
        staged a demonstration for
        cadets and the public yesterday.
        All types of equipment
        used by the Royal Artillery
        were on view.

        There was also Bluewater, the
        75 mile surface to surface guided
        missile, which is not expected to be
        in service before 1964, and the self-propelled
        105mm gun with a range
        of 11 miles, which will replace the
        25 pounder in Germany.

        ## MOBILITY DEMONSTRATED

        New means of cross country
        mobility were demonstrated by C
        Battery of 29 Commando Regt.
        Royal Artillery, which since January
        has been in support of the
        Royal Marine Commando Brigade.

        They moved a 105mm pack
        howitzer across country in hand
        trolleys after it had been dismantled.
        It was then carried across
        a water obstacle on wire cable and
        reassembled.

        The method of getting guns up
        and down cliffs was also demonstrated,
        as was their transport by
        helicopter. When the three guns
        had been assembled, tanks were
        engaged.

        ## ASHORE BY HELICOPTER

        Ninety-four Amphibious Support
        Regt. demonstrated gunner observations
        parties going ashore by
        helicopter to direct naval gunfire.
        All members of this regiment are
        parachutists.

        An Auster air observation post
        demonstrated tactical flying whilst
        ranging a battery of 5.5in howitzers.
        Two of the Austers belonged
        to 5 Regiment Royal Artillery in
        accordance with the recent policy
        of incorporating light aircraft in
        units.

        Robert, the new field surveillance
        radar, and Green Archer,
        the new mortar locating radar,
        both demonstrated their ability to
        locate targets and direct fire
        against them.

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Senate
        investigators said here the Air
        Force rejected proposals for fixed
        fees on early Bomarc missile contracts
        and insisted on incentive
        provisions which cost millions of
        dollars in additional profits.

        Staff investigators for the Senate
        investigations subcommittee
        testified that in negotiating incentive
        contracts with the Boeing
        firm, the Air Force had no production
        experience on which to
        base cost estimates.

        Spokesmen for the General Accounting
        Office (GAO) testified
        that incentive contracts are seldom
        suitable when such cost data
        is not known.

        The testimony was given as the
        subcommittee began a study of
        Bomarc procurement.

        In an opening statement, Chairman
        John L. McClellan, D-Ark.,
        questioned the use of incentive
        contracts. He said the subcommittee
        wanted to know whether the
        method used in buying such a
        weapon "has by its very nature
        generated unnecessary or excessive
        profits."

        Before digging into procurement
        of the nuclear-tipped antiaircraft
        Bomarc, the subcommittee took
        testimony from its staff which
        said Boeing made more than $900
        million from almost $12 billion
        worth of business with the government
        over 11 years.

        Working from a statistical table,
        subcommittee investigator Thomas
        E. Nunnally, on loan from the
        GAO, said Boeing's annual profits
        before taxes varied from a low of
        36 per cent of the company's net
        investment in 1951 and 1960 to as
        high as 108 per cent in 1953.

        ## Profit to Boeing

        Subcommittee investigator Paul
        J. Tierney testified that Boeing's
        13 major contracts for the Bomarc
        missile cost the government $1,631,539,000
        from 1951 to 1961 with
        $124,210,000 of the total representing
        profit to Boeing.

        In April 1958, Tierney said, the
        Air Force contracted with Boeing
        for production of 78 A-model Bomarcs.
        The contract first called for
        a target cost of $112 million and
        an 8 per cent basic profit.

        It provided incentive provisions
        under which Boeing could benefit
        from any lower production costs
        but pay for part of any additional
        expense.

        Boeing had first proposed a fixed
        fee contract which would have set
        Boeing profit at 6 per cent of a
        slightly higher cost target.

        The job finally cost the government
        about $94 million, of which
        some $12 million was profit to Boeing,
        Tierney said. He estimated
        that the Boeing proposal would
        have saved about $5.23 million.

        In May, 1959, Tierney said, Boeing
        wanted a similar fixed fee arrangement
        on a contract for 116
        Bomarc-B missiles and their installations.
        But under an incentive
        plan which was negotiated, the job
        cost about $191 million with some
        $20 million in profits, he said. The
        Boeing plan would have saved
        some $5.9 million, according to
        Tierney.

        ## But Misses Glamor Role

        # Eglin AFB Doing Big Missile Job

        EGLIN AFB, Fla. (UPI)---Cape
        Canaveral may be the glamor spot
        in American missilery, but much
        of the "bread and butter" work
        in developing U.S. missile strength
        is done at this sprawling Air Force
        test center tucked away in the
        Florida Panhandle.

        Established in 1935 as the Valparaiso
        Bombing and Gunnery
        Range, the field has grown into
        one of the most complex research
        and development facilities in the
        Air Force.

        Skybolt---the nation's air-launched
        thermonuclear punch---was
        developed here and is still being
        tested by personnel from the
        Air Proving Ground Center
        (APGC). A ballistic missile, Skybolt
        is designed to destroy targets
        1,000 miles away from where it is
        dropped from the wings of huge
        jets.

        This is also the base where the
        Bomarcs---the ground-to-air missiles---were
        developed and tested.
        The Bomarcs, capable of destroying
        an enemy bomber or jet fighter
        400 miles away from American
        soil, are now in operation and
        crews are being trained here.

        Also under development here are
        the GAM77 and GAM83 air-to-surface
        guided missiles. The GAM83,
        designed for use from the F105
        Thunderchief, is capable of destroying
        targets up to two miles
        away. The GAM77, capable of seeking
        out a target 500 miles away,
        also can be carried by the Strategic
        Air Command B52.

        But missiles aren't the only business
        here. Nearby Santa Rosa Island
        in the Gulf of Mexico is the
        scene of many a scientific probe.

        Here APGC personnel conduct
        space launches at the rate of
        nearly one a day to help all the
        research agencies of the Air Force
        systems command and the Office
        of Aerospace Research.

        Using the Nike-ASP, the Arcus
        Robin and the 42-foot, three-stage
        Exos rocket, the test center conducts
        tests into the characteristics
        of the upper altitude, tests recovery
        systems for space equipment,
        explores new communications theories
        and extends the knowledge
        of weather characteristics.

        The tests are usually conducted
        over the Eglin Gulf test range,
        45,000 square miles of the Gulf of
        Mexico, from the Florida Panhandle
        to Key West.

        One of the busiest facilities here
        is the climatic laboratory. Want
        to find out how a new jet engine
        will react in minus 65 degree cold?
        Or how the Army's newest tank
        will stand the strain of 115 degree
        heat? The laboratory can duplicate
        any climatic condition found
        on earth---and some that are strictly
        out of this world.

        ## Military Manned Satellite Reported

        # Forces Eye Larger Space Role

        NEW YORK (AP) --- The New
        York Times said the Defense Department
        is embarking upon a
        man-in-space program "to prevent
        military control of space by the
        Soviet Union."

        In a dispatch from Washington,
        the Times said "after years of
        reluctance and opposition, the department
        has finally accepted the
        need for a military space program
        aimed at control of space as well
        as its exploration."

        Until now, the U.S. space program
        has been largely a civilian
        effort.

        The Times said the Defense Department
        now "has decided that
        the Air Force should develop the
        technology for a manned satellite
        capable of inspecting and destroying
        a hostile vehicle in space.

        "Beyond this decision, the department,
        at the urging of the
        White House and the National
        Aeronautics and Space Council, has
        undertaken a six-month study to
        draft an enlarged military space
        program."

        The decision, itself, the Times
        said, was reached "after years of
        reluctance and opposition."

        ## 'Major Change'

        Defense Department officials
        were said to prefer to view the
        decision and study "as only a
        modification of its past position on
        military activities in space. However,
        in the opinion of high Administration
        officials and industry
        observers, the decision signals a
        major change in direction leading
        to significant enlargement and
        purpose of the national space program."

        The Times said "with increasing
        vigor, Air Force leaders have been
        urging for the past three years
        that space is a new area for potential
        military operations. They
        have contended that the United
        States must embark upon a vigorous
        military program, including a
        man in space if it is to meet the
        potential threat of Soviet control
        of space."

        # Scientist Suggests Moon May Have Plenty of Water

        CLEVELAND (AP) --- The possibility
        that the moon may have
        an abundant water supply --- including
        geysers and subsurface
        glaciers---was suggested here by
        an internationally known lunar expert.

        Dr. Zdenek Kopal, British astrophysicist,
        said the moon's water
        supply may be so great that if
        squeezed out it could cover the
        lunar globe's surface to a uniform
        depth of 984 feet.

        He told space scientists attending
        a lunar missions meeting of
        the American Rocket Society that
        his conclusions were reached deductively,
        based on known facts
        about the composition and behavior
        of celestial bodies.

        Water is composed of hydrogen
        and oxygen, and a lunar water
        supply would greatly simplify the
        supply problem of setting up a
        self-sufficient moon base with its
        own air supply.

        In adding his support to those
        in the controversy who believe
        water is present on the moon,
        Kopal said there is a possibility
        the earth's smaller companion may
        have a permafrost several hundred
        feet deep.

        Ice close to the lunar surface,
        he continued, could form glaciers
        covered by dust and debris. He
        contended such glaciers could take
        the form of domes or minor bulges
        numerous astronomers have observed
        in certain regions of the
        moon.

        Kopal agrees with the widely
        accepted theory that the moon was
        formed by an accumulation of tiny
        particles of cold matter in space
        drawn together by the mutual pull
        of gravity.

        His theory contends further:

        These particles contained volatile
        compounds, including water,
        locked within their crystal structure.
        A relatively high proportion
        of water has been found in stony
        meteorites.

        ## Internal Heat

        When the moon was formed,
        spontaneous disintegration of the
        radioactive elements present
        heated its internal temperature
        until its interior glowed "much
        like the inside of a terrestrial
        blast furnace." This heat broke the
        solid-state bonds holding the water
        in crystals and liberated it as
        superheated steam.

        He gave this concept of how
        lunar steam might behave:

        "Along any cavity or crack
        temporarily formed in the crust,
        it should be able to escape under
        its own pressure toward the outer
        and cooler layers, where it should
        condense into the liquid phase and
        eventually freeze in the subsurface
        layer. . . .

        "Suppose that in an extreme
        case it may erupt in occasional
        spurts as a geyser. No such
        phenomenon has, to be sure, so far
        been actually observed on the
        moon, although it would be very
        difficult to detect --- virtually the
        only reasonable chance of detection
        being along the bright edge of the
        moon, when sunlight scattered on
        dispersing gas molecules could be
        seen against the dark background
        of the sky. . . ."

        # MISSILE FIRED AUTOMATICALLY

        ## EXTREME ACCURACY

        By Our Defence Correspondent

        The American Army has pressed
        for production of the Nike-Zeus
        to be authorised. There are severe
        critics, particularly in the Air
        Force, of the missile's effectiveness.

        To intercept intercontinental
        missiles the system depends on
        immensely powerful radars and
        high-speed target interception
        computers. There are "acquisition"
        and detection radars, "discrimination"
        radars, to tell warheads
        from decoys, and target-tracking
        radars.

        The Nike-Zeus, on the basis of
        computer calculations about the
        ICBM's speed and course, is fired
        automatically. Its range must be
        of several hundred miles. Its
        accuracy needs to be phenomenal,
        since its target travels at four or
        five miles a second.

        # NEW TOWN IN DANGER

        CANCELLING the Blue
        Water missile could
        mean that 1,500 workers in
        Stevenage New Town, Hertfordshire,
        lose their jobs.

        Last night Mr. Martin Maddan,
        Tory MP for Hitchin, said
        the Government had given no
        thought to providing other work.

        The British Aircraft Corporations
        English Electric factory at
        Stevenage, which employs 4,500,
        starts laying off workers within
        a fortnight. Mr. Maddan said
        the factory may close completely
        in a few years unless more Government
        work immediately replaces
        the Blue Water contract.

        "It is monstrous that the
        Government---which have a
        great responsibility towards this
        new town---should treat Stevenage
        in this way," he said.

        BRITAIN must review her
        defence policy at once to
        avoid wasting millions of
        pounds a Labour MP said
        yesterday.

        Mr. G. W. Reynolds, MP for
        North Islington, told a Labour
        Party Summer School at Holmbury
        St. Mary, near Dorking,
        Surrey, that the money saved
        could be more profitably used on
        conventional arms and improving
        social services.

        America was abandoning Thor
        missile sites in Britain. And he
        thought, in two years the B47
        bombers would be unnecessary
        because the U.S. would then
        have 200 Polaris missiles and 400
        Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
        as an effective deterrent.

        ## Cost of Skybolt

        "America herself will not need
        the Skybolt. Will she in fact
        continue to develop it if the
        U.K. remains the only potential
        customer?"

        Skybolt was meant to extend
        the life of the V-bomber force.
        The Government proposed to
        adapt 24 aircraft to carry two
        each. He believed the changeover,
        missiles, and maintenance
        for three or four years would
        cost £80million to £90million.

        Mr. Reynolds said that perhaps
        only six of the 24 would
        reach their target. For "this
        colossal amount of money . . .
        to my mind, this presents
        neither a credible independent
        deterrent force, nor any worthwhile
        contribution to the Western
        deterrent."

        A FIERCE, new political
        row over the American
        rocket Skybolt is on the
        way between the Government
        and the Labour
        Party.

        Skybolt has been ordered by
        the R.A.F.

        The row will show whether
        Britain is going to stay an
        independent nuclear Power or
        shield under an American
        H-bomb "umbrella."

        Labour leaders are planning to
        open the attack on Skybolt at
        the party's October conference.

        It will be the climax to a general
        onslaught on Defence Minister
        Peter Thorneycroft's missile
        policy.

        Labour leaders believe Skybolt
        will repeat the British "Blue
        Water" missile story---too
        much money for too little
        effect.

        Mr. Thorneycroft is hoping to
        get about 400 Skybolts at a cut-rate
        of £150 million.

        It was this "defence-on-the-cheap"
        line which provoked a
        strong attack on him by the
        Tory Backbench Defence
        Committee just before the
        House of Commons dispersed.

        ## Independent

        The R.A.F. is relying on 1965
        delivery of the weapon to carry
        on as an independent nuclear
        force.

        But Labour's defence experts
        think it inevitable that America
        should take over completely on
        the nuclear missile front, while
        Britain devotes more money
        to conventional forces.

        Labour M.P. Mr. Gerald Reynolds,
        who acts as Mr. George
        Brown's Parliamentary Private
        Secretary, spoke about Skybolt
        at a Labour Party meeting at
        Dorking, Surrey, yesterday.

        He said that a "colossal amount
        of money" would be spent on
        adapating 24 V-bombers to take
        Skybolt.

        "America herself will not need
        the Skybolt. Will she in fact
        continue to develop it if Britain
        remains the only potential customers?

        "Mr. Thorneycroft should act
        now and stop the possible
        waste of millions of pounds,"
        Mr. Reynolds added.

        MOSCOW, Monday.

        MR. KHRUSCHEV claims
        that Russia has anti-rocket
        rockets which can "hit
        a fly in outer space." He made
        this boast to 14 American
        newspaper editors in the
        Kremlin recently. The report
        of the meeting was published
        to-day.

        He also claims that Russia has
        a "global rocket" which is immune
        to all anti-aircraft or anti-rocket
        defences. "We know about such
        things," he went on, "because we
        have our own anti-rocket rockets."

        The Russians first announced
        that they were developing an anti-rocket
        rocket two years ago. The
        first claim that it was successfully
        in service was made by Marshal
        Malinovsky, the Defence Minister,
        at the 22nd party congress last
        October.

        The "global rocket" was first
        mentioned by Mr. Khruschev in
        March. It is still not clear what
        exactly he means by it.

        It may be a satellite which can
        be brought to earth at any point in
        its orbit. It may also be an extremely
        long range inter-continental
        missile.

        ## NO SURPRISE

        ## Promising prototype

        OUR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT
        cabled last night: Mr.
        Khruschev's talk of an accurate
        anti-missile missile and of global
        rockets caused no surprise in
        Washington. The American Air
        Force, which has heard both claims
        from Russian leaders before,
        declined to comment.

        The official belief is that Russia
        probably does not yet possess an
        effective defence system against
        missiles. It is conceivable that she
        has developed a prototype which
        has shown promise in tests.

        CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI)---The
        Navy's missile-firing submarine
        fleet will take a major step
        forward next month with the
        maiden flight of a Polaris missile
        capable of hitting harder and
        ranging 1,000 miles farther than
        ever before.

        The added range is expected to
        put all of Russia within striking
        distance of American Polaris-armed
        submarines.

        Current versions of the Polaris
        are capable of hurling their warheads
        up to 1,725 miles when fired
        from a submerged submarine. The
        new model---known as the A3
        Polaris---will have a maximum
        range of 2,800 miles.

        ## 'Ultimate Goal'

        "The A3 Polaris is the ultimate
        goal toward which we've been
        working," said a spokesman for
        the Polaris project. He indicated
        it would include a host of improvements
        over its predecessors,
        the A1 and A2 models.

        It is expected to have room for
        a bigger nuclear warhead, though
        the Defense Department has kept
        the exact details under close security
        wraps.

        The first of the new 2,800-mile
        Polarises will be fired from a
        fixed launching pad, and the Navy
        has set next month as the target
        date for the launch. Then the A3
        Polaris will go through a complete
        land and sea testing program before
        being put on combat-ready
        submarines sometime late in 1963.

        The new Polaris will be the
        same size---31 feet long---as the
        current version. Its longer range
        are the results of refinements in
        American missile technology.

        The two main factors responsible
        for the big jump in the
        Polaris' range are "hotter fuels"
        and a lightweight construction.

        # House Unit Assails 'Low-Pressure' Centaur Effort

        WASHINGTON (AP) --- House
        investigators have blamed both
        government and industry for
        making only "a low-pressure effort"
        to perfect Centaur, "a very
        important and badly needed" space
        rocket.

        A report by the Science and
        Astronautics Committee voiced
        deep concern over a series of delays
        and mishaps, including explosions,
        that have plagued the Centaur program.
        The liquid hydrogen booster
        is designed to kick a heavier payload
        farther into space than any
        other chemical rocket.

        The committee said the Centaur
        program is now at least 18 months
        behind schedule. It asked the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA) to decide
        within 30 days whether Centaur
        merits more time, money and talent
        and the top priority rating that
        the congressional group believes it
        should have.

        In a finding that Centaur appears
        to have had "a low-pressure effort
        during its entire history," the committee
        criticized the prime contractors,
        General Dynamics Astronautics,
        saying it provided a
        staff of insufficient number and
        quality.

        NASA also was accused of inadequate
        management of the program.
        The report noted that for
        some time a handful of Air Force
        officers, loaned to NASA, attempted
        from Los Angeles to
        supervise intricate technical phases
        of Centaur development that were
        being carried out in San Diego and
        in West Palm Beach, Fla.

        There was no immediate comment
        from NASA.

        The committee said that Centaur,
        because of problems and delays,
        had already lost two of its
        assigned missions, launching of the
        military communications satellite
        and NASA's space probe to the
        vicinity of Venus.

        The report found that development
        of the Centaur engine by
        Pratt and Whitney was first delayed
        by lack of funds because
        NASA gave higher importance to
        other rocket programs.

        Then there were three explosions
        of test engines, the committee reported,
        that were belatedly traced
        to ignition troubles.

        After months of delay, the first
        Centaur was launched from Cape
        Canaveral last May 8, only to blow
        up 54 seconds after lift-off.

        The latest chapter in Centaur's
        history of mishaps came when a
        backup vehicle, sitting idle on a
        test stand, was badly damaged by
        the nearby explosion of an Air
        Force missile.

        The report said that NASA has
        yet to set a date for another
        launch attempt and that it is unlikely
        to take place before early
        next year.

        SEATTLE (AP) --- Secretary of
        State Dean Rusk has urged that
        space activities be brought under
        international regulation at once---lest
        space be turned into a military
        arena.

        Rusk took a "somber look at
        what could happen" in a speech
        prepared for a Seattle World's
        Fair audience the day after U.S.
        astronaut Scott Carpenter's successful
        orbiting of the earth.

        Unless there is international
        space supervision and peaceful cooperation,
        which the United States
        has proposed, and which has not
        won Communist acceptance, Rusk
        said:

        "The frontiers of space might
        be pierced by huge nuclear-propelled
        dreadnaughts, armed with
        thermonuclear weapons.

        "The moon might be turned into
        a military base.

        "Ways might be found to cascade
        radioactive waves upon an
        enemy.

        "Weather control might become
        a military weapon."

        Rusk said man can put outer
        space to uses which might imperil
        civilization and even life on earth---or
        he can use it to benefit the
        human race.

        The secretary of state recalled
        that when the United States first
        developed the atomic weapon,
        late in World War II, it followed
        up with a plan for international
        control. The Soviets rejected this
        as "atomic blackmail," thus bringing
        on the postwar nuclear arms
        race, he said.

        "Now we are in the earlier
        stages of another scientific technical,
        and human adventure, as
        staggering to the imagination as
        the unleashing of the atom and as
        challenging to man's ability to
        organize his affairs with at least
        a modicum of good sense," Rusk
        continued.

        Rusk outlined U.S. proposals to
        make space a peaceful area.
        Among them were keeping outer
        space free for use by all nations,
        extension of international law to
        outer space, making applications
        of space technology available to
        all nations, and the outlawing of
        orbiting mass-destruction weapons.

        ## Reds' Goals

        As for Communist tactics in
        general, the U.S. foreign affairs
        chief noted the difference between
        Moscow's advocacy of a slower
        pace in attempting to communize
        the rest of the world versus Peiping's
        "hard," militant line.

        "But both of the major branches
        of the Communist movement are
        determined to bury us, and each
        seems intent on demonstrating
        that its effort of interring us is
        the more efficacious," he said.

        Outlining what he termed a
        "win" or "positive" strategy
        against the Communists, the secretary
        of state said the United
        States seeks to build the strength
        of the non-Communist world,
        promote close ties with industrialized
        nations, step up economies of
        backward areas, and develop a
        world community of nations --- "a
        world of order and justice under
        law."

        # Scott Carpenter Receives Navy's Astronaut Wings

        WASHINGTON (AP)---M. Scott
        Carpenter, America's second man in
        orbit, has received the Navy's special
        astronaut wings.

        Lt Cmdr Carpenter smilingly
        offered to let any other naval aviator
        wear them---but only for a day
        at a time.

        Presentation was made by Secretary
        of the Navy Fred Korth, who
        said he was hopeful this is "only
        the beginning of many such ceremonies."

        ## Third Recipient

        Carpenter is the third man to
        get the Navy's special astronaut
        wings. Cmdr Alan B. Shapard Jr.,
        the first American into space, and
        Marine Lt Col John H. Glenn Jr.,
        the first American to orbit the
        earth, received the wings earlier.

        Carpenter, in one of the rare instances
        he has worn his Navy uniform
        since becoming an astronaut
        more than three years ago, was the
        honor guest at a luncheon given
        by Korth before the ceremony.

        # Army Signal Satellite Project Given USAF

        WASHINGTON (AP) --- Shaking
        up the military communications
        satellite program, the Defense Department
        stripped the Army of the
        main development role and gave
        it to the Air Force.

        The Army, which has been working
        on the "Advent" program for
        nearly two years, was left only the
        responsibility for the system's
        ground equipment while the Air
        Force develops the spacecraft.

        A Defense Department spokesman
        said the action is expected to
        result in the beginnings of an operational
        system, by 1964, rather
        than 1966. The military system
        would function entirely separately
        from the proposed worldwide civilian
        satellite communications system.

        The spokesman refrained from
        criticizing the work of the Army,
        which has spent about $170 million
        on the project so far. Another $100
        million has been sought for the
        coming year.

        The compelling fact in the decision,
        he said, is that the 1,300-pound
        satellite now contemplated
        in the Army program would be too
        heavy for the rockets now available.

        He also said project costs have
        been running high.

        The objective will be a 500-pound
        satellite which can be lofted by
        the Air Force's Atlas-Agena rocket
        combination, already a veteran of
        space experiments.

        The spokesman said there would
        be little loss in efficiency in making
        the payload smaller.

        "You save perhaps two years
        and essentially you don't lose very
        much performance," he said.

        The plan is to send up more
        than three but fewer than 10 microwave
        satellites to circle the earth
        in a 24-hour orbit around the
        equator. They would operate at an
        altitude of 22,300 miles and be used
        to relay voice and other messages
        almost instantaneously.

        The system would be operated
        with a ground station near Camp
        Roberts, Calif., and another near
        Ft. Dix, N. J. A shipborne station
        also is planned.

        At the same time, the Defense
        Department announced the Air
        Force will develop a second system
        of 40 or 50 smaller communications
        satellites which would
        move about the earth in a polar
        orbit from 5,000 to 7,000 miles up.
        It would have both voice and teletype
        channels with this medium
        altitude system. The spokesman
        said the Defense Department is
        "hedging our bets" for an urgently
        needed communications satiellite
        network.

        Some of the parts already developed
        by the Army will be usable
        in the revamped program, the
        spokesman said.

        The spokesman summed up the
        impact of the move as "putting
        the Air Force into space and the
        Army on the ground."

        The action leaves only the Navy's
        Transit Navigation Satellite System
        out of the Air Force fold, as
        far as military space projects are
        concerned.

        The Defense Communications
        Agency, a Pentagon organization
        covering all the services, was given
        responsibility of assuring the
        meshing of the ground and space
        components of the Advent System.

        There was no immediate indication
        what effect the Defense Department
        move would have on contracts
        which have already been
        granted by the Army.

        Chiefly affected would be the
        General Electric Co. in Philadelphia
        which is developing a satellite for
        the Army, and the Bendix Corp.
        in Ann Arbor, Mich. where work
        is being done on communications
        equipment for ground stations and
        the satellites.

        PILOT Jacqueline Cochrane
        led a group of
        young women before Congress
        today to ask for a
        chance for them to become
        the world's first
        space-women.

        She was backed by 31-year-old
        Jerrie Cobb, first
        woman to undergo all the
        Mercury astronaut selection
        tests, and by a
        Senator's wife with eight
        children.

        They revealed that 12
        American women out of 25
        examined have secretly
        passed the Mercury tests at
        the Lovelace Foundation,
        Alberquerque, New Mexico.

        Those successful included
        twin 35-year-old sisters, three
        married women---and a
        divorcee.

        Jacqueline Cochrane, who
        holds more speed, distance and
        altitude records than any other
        living person, wore a shimmering
        silk Chanel suit and chain-smoked
        as she testified to the
        House Committee on Science
        and Astronautics.

        She said her experience
        showed women would prove as
        fit as men, physically and psychologically,
        for space flying.

        ## Medicals

        She urged immediate medical
        tests on a large group of
        women, followed by an astronaut
        training programme.

        Jerrie Cobb told the committee
        that Miss Cochrane paid the
        expenses of the women who
        underwent the Mercury tests.

        Each woman had been
        pledged to secrecy. Until today
        none knew the other.

        Miss Cobb, dressed in black
        and with her blonde hair in a
        ponytail, said: "Each of us join
        in offering our abilities to our
        country's space efforts."

        She described herself as "the
        first woman candidate for
        space."

        She insisted there was no
        battle of the sexes and said
        women weighed less and needed
        less food and oxygen than men.
        They were more radiation-resistant,
        less prone to heart
        attacks, less susceptible to
        monotony, loneliness, heat, cold,
        pain and noise.

        A third blonde, Senator's wife
        Janey B. Hart---she has four
        boys and girls---wore a chunky
        gold bracelet and a huge astronaut's
        wrist watch as she told
        the Congressmen that space
        was being restricted to men,
        "like some sort of stag club."

        She said: "For many women,
        the Parents-Teachers Association

        Five---went into orbit
        yesterday.

        America's latest weather

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- Rep.
        George Miller, chairman of the
        House Committee on Science and
        Astronautics, says he believes a
        woman astronaut eventually will
        be fired into orbit around the
        earth.

        "Whether the time is right now
        or not is a question we're going to
        look into," the California Democrat
        said in a radio interview.

        Miller has appointed a subcommittee
        to hear complaints from
        women who claim they are being
        shut out of the nation's space program.

        "I can assure you there are a
        very vocal group of women in this
        country who believe we should
        have female astronauts," Miller
        said.

        As for his personal view, Miller
        said if a qualified woman could
        be found, he would be in favor of
        training her for the astronaut
        team. But he said he didn't know
        of any woman who could qualify
        as a test pilot --- a basic requirement
        for the astronaut team.

        ## All Do Not Agree

        Miller said all women do not
        agree they should share space exploration
        with their male counterparts.

        "There is at least one woman
        flier who is outstanding who feels
        that they should [...]
        said.

        But Miller [...]
        women had strong [...]
        they should be [...]

        hearings would be [...]

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- The
        House Space Committee ordered
        an investigation of alleged government
        discrimination against women
        in the nation's space exploration
        program.

        The committee, meeting in executive
        session, named Rep. Victor
        L. Anfuso, D-N.Y., as chairman of
        a special nine-man, two-women investigating
        subcommittee to look
        into complaints about male dominance
        in space.

        Anfuso said a number of women
        feel they are being discriminated
        against by the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration
        (NASA).

        The New York Democrat said
        he was not prepared to make any
        judgments in the controversy until
        all the evidence was in.

        In other action:

        ---The Senate Space Committee
        received assurance from the Pentagon's
        research chief that the Defense
        Department has no intention
        of moving in on programs which
        properly fall under the jurisdiction
        of NASA.

        ---The chairman of the House
        committee, Rep. George P. Miller,
        D-Calif., said the billions of dollars
        spent in the space race are
        not just an expression of "national
        ego" and the nation should have
        faith in a big payoff.

        Anfuso said perhaps NASA
        should consider the advantages of
        "the women's touch" when it sends
        teams on trips to Mars and other
        planets.

        Some doctors have said that
        women physically and mentally are
        better adapted to the stresses of
        outer space than men.

        Anfuso said the subcommittee
        staff would do some preliminary
        investigative work and that he
        hoped to begin open hearings in
        about three weeks.

        Two women members of the full
        committee---Rep. Jessica Weis, R-N.Y.,
        and Rep. Corinne Boyd Riley,
        D-S.C. --- were appointed to the
        special subcommittee.

        Neither the United States nor
        the Soviet Union, as far as is
        known, is training women astronauts
        at the present time. Both
        nations have sent males into orbit.

        In the Senate, Dr. Harold Brown,
        the Defense Department's director
        of research and engineering, testified
        on the Administration's request
        for $3.8 billion in authorizations
        for NASA.

        Replying to questions of Chairman
        Robert S. Kerr, D-Okla.,
        Brown said the Defense Department
        does not intend to "preempt
        those areas that are within the
        proper purview" of NASA.

        After Brown answered specific
        questions on Pentagon programs,
        Kerr said he believes the two
        agencies are in "harmonious cooperation"
        as contemplated by the
        Space Act.

        Brown also testified that it eventually
        may be desirable to have
        a manned space station to meet
        military needs. Studies of this are
        being conducted, he said.

        In disavowing any encroachment
        on NASA, Brown said the Defense
        Department plans to carry the
        DynaSoar program directly to
        manned orbital flights without
        undertaking suborbital trips.

        WASHINGTON --- Astronauts
        John B. Glenn Jr. and Malcolm
        Scott Carpenter found themselves
        --- reluctantly --- trying to explain
        why it would not be practical for
        some time to let any women join
        their space team.

        Glenn and Carpenter, the first
        Americans to orbit the earth, took
        pains to say they were not criticizing
        the ladies---but they must
        first be trained test pilots.

        "The best qualified people whatever
        their sex, color or creed should
        be picked," Glenn added.

        But after he said it, Glenn figured
        maybe he went too far with
        his show of gallantry when he
        said enthusiastically "we'd welcome
        them with open arms" if
        any women would qualify.

        The crowded hearing of the
        House Space and Astronautics Committee
        went silent and then exploded
        in laughter.

        George M. Low, director of spacecraft
        missions for NASA, said none
        of the six women among 250 applicants
        for astronaut training have
        been able to meet all of the
        stringent qualifications established
        earlier this year.

        Low also told the committee
        that the pool of qualified men was
        more than ample to meet the need
        for the 40 or 50 astronauts required
        to carry out presently
        planned space explorations.

        He pointed out that none of the
        women space hopefuls was a jet
        test pilot, that some of them lacked
        the required scientific or engineering
        education and "others were too
        old."

        Low said "NASA certainly doesn't
        want to leave the women out." But,
        he added, the available equipment
        was now "so very much loaded
        that to permit women to use it
        would interfere with the space program."

        Earlier, he told the committee
        the federal space agency has cut
        its new group of potential astronauts
        to 32 and is starting rigorous
        testing before choosing the five or
        10 who will join the U.S. space
        team.

        NASA began its search last
        April for additional astronauts to
        join the seven now in training, and
        quickly received 250 applications,
        Low said. The list was trimmed to
        63 who met the age, experience and
        physical standards set by NASA
        and then cut to 32 during further
        screening last month.

        Final selection will be made by
        this fall, he said.

        Astronaut Carpenter said that
        present standards for astronauts
        are not a matter of protecting
        women but of protecting the program.

        LT.-COL. JOHN GLENN promised a warm reception
        to-day to any woman with better qualifications as an
        astronaut than the present all-male team. "We will welcome
        her aboard with open arms," he said.

        When the laughter in the Congress committee-room subsided
        the astronaut added with a grin that he hoped his remark could
        be struck from the record "in the interests of my continued
        happy home life."

        Col. Glenn and Lt.-Cdr. Scott
        Carpenter, another orbital Astronaut,
        were speaking at a House of
        Representatives Space Committee
        inquiry into claims of discrimination
        against women by the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration.

        They denied any official ruling
        by NASA against women Astronauts.
        But Col. Glenn reiterated
        the NASA policy that jet plane
        test pilots provide the best source
        of space crew talent.

        ## CLAIMS DISCOUNTED

        This effectively rules out women.
        He discounted claims made yesterday
        that no fewer than 13 women
        have passed the rigid official
        physical and psychological tests
        prescribed for male astronauts.

        These tests, he said, were designed
        to discover health defects.
        He went on: "My mother could
        probably pass the physical given
        for the Washington Redskins (a
        football team) but I doubt if she
        could play many games."

        When a committee member
        asked why a woman would not be
        a good companion on a trip to the
        moon, Col. Glenn replied that he
        had nothing against women.

        But he indicated that he would
        not be interested in feminine companionship
        in such circumstances.
        What he wanted in the opposite
        seat was the best qualified person
        available, man or woman, regardless
        of race, colour or creed.

        ## SPACEWOMEN

        ## Discrimination claimed

        WOMEN have certain advantages
        over men as astronauts.
        They weigh less, consume less food
        and oxygen, are more resistant to
        radiation and less susceptible to
        monotony, loneliness, heat, cold,
        pain and noise.

        This was claimed by Miss Jerrie
        Cobb, 31, a pilot with 10,000 flying
        hours to her credit, at the start of a
        Congress committee inquiry to-day
        into alleged discrimination against
        women in space.

        # Orbiting Tiros V May Pave U.S.-Russ Path

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP) ---
        America's newest weather satellite,
        Tiros V, orbiting on its hurricane-and-storm-hunting
        mission,
        may prove to be the first step toward
        a cooperative space program
        between the United States and
        Russia.

        The weather-watch satellite,
        launched Tuesday from Cape Canaveral,
        will photograph cloud cover
        over a much greater area of the
        world than any of the previous
        four Tiros satellites. Included is
        the sky above most of the Soviet
        Union.

        During its anticipated four-month
        useful lifetime, Tiros V's
        two wide-angle cameras are expected
        to snap hundreds of pictures
        of weather systems over Russia.
        A National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration official said
        the photographs will be available
        to Soviet Meteorologists if
        they want them.

        Presumably the Russians will
        ask for the pictures. Earlier this
        month, American and Soviet scientists
        signed a pact in Geneva
        agreeing to share data received
        from their respective weather satellites---with
        a long-range look at
        possibly building a broad mutual
        space research program.

        The representatives of the two
        major space powers also discussed
        the possibility of coordinating
        tracking, launch dates and satellite
        objectives to reduce exploration
        overlaps. There was no provision
        for a common launching.

        As yet, Russia has not launched
        a weather satellite. It reportedly is
        developing one, but it is not known
        whether it is similar to the Tiros
        system.

        The pact was the first concrete
        result of an exchange of letters
        earlier this year between President
        Kennedy and Premier Nikita
        S. Khrushchev.

        The non-controversial meteorological
        satellite was selected as the
        first area of discussion, with communications
        satellites expected
        next. Further discussions between
        the scientists of the two nations
        are scheduled soon in Moscow.

        Meanwhile, Tiros V whizzed
        about the earth every 100.5 minutes
        at peak speed of 17,140 miles
        an hour and altitudes ranging
        from 367 to 604 miles.

        A guidance error shot the satellite
        higher than planned. But this
        did not interfere with its camera
        eyes.

        On the first orbit, the vehicle
        transmitted pictures of cloud cover
        over the southeastern United
        States and a few orbits later relayed
        photos of storm clouds off
        Newfoundland. The cloud details
        provide vital information on what
        conditions exist for various weather
        patterns.

        ## Hurricane Season

        The launching was timed to coincide
        with the 1962 hurricane season,
        which began last week. However,
        tropical storm activity normally
        does not reach a peak until
        late August and September, and
        Tiros V's cameras are geared to
        be aimed at the spawning grounds
        in that period.

        With its wider coverage---including
        all territory between the Arctic
        and Antarctic circles---Tiros V
        will be able to record Pacific typhoons,
        ice breakup, and fog and
        large storm systems in the northern
        latitudes. Ground stations can
        command its cameras to photograph
        a suspected weather disturbance
        practically anywhere in the
        world.

        Two more Tiros satellites are
        planned in an experimental program
        whose goal is the start of an
        operational weather satellite system
        by next year. A network of
        operational satellites, called Project
        Nimbus, would provide continuous
        weather coverage over all
        areas of the globe.

        POLAR LOOKOUT --- Tiros V, new U.S. "weather-eye satellite"
        whose main task is hurricane-hunting, is orbiting the earth on an
        unusual path designed to permit it also to keep a close watch on

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
        (AP) --- Hurricane-hunting
        Tiros V rocketed into orbit
        Tuesday to seek the cause of
        killer storms and perhaps
        help devise means of taming
        them.

        A three-stage Thor-Delta rocket
        blasted off here at 7:18 a.m., carrying
        the fifth in the series of
        weather-eye satellites.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration announced
        about two hours later that the
        satellite was in orbit and had
        transmitted its first series of cloud
        cover pictures.

        A pair of television cameras in
        the satellite made pictures as Tiros
        V completed its first orbit and the
        photographs were relayed instantly
        to a tracking station at Wallops
        Island, Va.

        ## 'Very Good Pictures'

        Dr. Morris Tepper, chief of satellite
        programs for the civilian space
        agency, told a news conference six
        hours after the launching that the
        Virginia tracking station had received
        "very good pictures of a
        storm vortex off Newfoundland."

        The satellite, launched into an
        orbit ranging in altitude from 367
        to 604 miles, is circling the earth
        every 100.5 minutes.

        The robot weatherman achieved
        orbit despite a malfunction in the
        Thor-Delta guidance system.

        Project official Robert Gray reported
        that 20 seconds after
        launching a short circuit developed
        in ground equipment designed to
        beam radio commands to the
        guidance package.

        "After that, the rocket had to
        rely on its automatic pilot to fly
        its proper course," Gray said.

        THE UNITED STATES last
        week placed into orbit
        around the earth Tiros V---a 286-pound
        weather-eye satellite carrying
        two television cameras.

        Its main task will be hurricane-hunting.
        But space agency scientists
        hope that its cameras also
        will provide vital data on storms,
        fog, ice breakup in the Arctic
        and typhoons in the Pacific.
        Tiro's weather warnings will be
        relayed to any danger areas in
        the world.

        In another space development,
        the three major U.S. television
        networks and European broadcasters
        announced that the first
        live transatlantic TV programs---to
        be transmitted by a communications
        satellite---are planned for
        next month.

        Transmission will be by the
        Telstar communications satellite
        which will be launched on an
        Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral
        early in July. Exact dates for the
        two transatlantic programs will
        be determined after the launching.

        At Edwards Air Force Base,
        Calif., the X15 plane rocketed
        more than 47 miles into space,
        achieved its designed altitude
        maximum and set a new altitude
        record in the process.

        Air Force Maj Robert M. White
        was at the controls. His altitude
        was given as 250,000 feet---precisely
        what he aimed for. His
        speed was approximately 3,682
        miles an hour.

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---The space agency plans to launch another
        Tiros satellite next week to help the weather bureau keep a watch
        out for Alma.

        Alma, the bureau said, is the name picked for the first tropical storm
        of the 1962 season in the Atlantic, Caribbean or Gulf of Mexico.

        Tiros III did such a good job of spotting hurricanes last year that the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration (NASA) and weather
        bureau want to have a new and
        energetic satellite up in time to
        perform a similar service this year.

        Tiros III discovered one hurricane,
        Esther, as it was forming in
        the Atlantic last year. Altogether
        it photographed five hurricanes
        and one tropical storm in the Atlantic,
        two hurricanes and a tropical
        storm in the eastern Pacific,
        and nine typhoons in the central
        and western Pacific.

        Tiros IV, launched Feb. 8, is
        failing, and so the main burden of
        hurricane hunting will fall on
        Tiros V. NASA expects to launch
        the new weather observatory next
        week, not before Tuesday.

        ## To Cover Wider Area

        The new weather eye will be
        launched at a higher angle to the
        equator to enable it to cover more
        of the earth than its predecessors.
        Tiros IV traverses a band 3,360
        miles wide around the planet's
        middle. Tiros V will cover a region
        4,060 miles wide.

        In addition to Tiros V, a host of
        ships, planes, and radar stations
        will be set to report Alma's birth
        and development.

        Names picked for subsequent
        tropical storms this year are
        Becky, Celja, Daisy, Ella, Flossy,
        Greta, Hallie, Inez, Judith, Kendra,
        Lois, Marsha, Noreen, Orpha,
        Patty, Rena, Sherry, Thora, Vicky
        and Wilna.

        The weather bureau has arranged
        to transmit cloud photographs
        taken by Tiros V by photofacsimile
        to warning centers in San
        Juan, Puerto Rico, New Orleans,
        and Miami. There they will be
        used in tracking and forecasting
        storms.

        # 3-Stage Zeus Successful in Test Firing

        POINT MUGU, Calif. (UPI)---A
        three stage Nike-Zeus antimissile
        has been successfully fired in what
        Army officials termed a "high-altitude
        shot."

        "All three of the solid-fuel rocket
        motors were fired," said Brig Gen
        John G. Zierdt, deputy CG of the
        Army Ordnance Missile Cmd.

        The two main propulsion motors
        were fired in rapid sequence. The
        third stage fired later in flight
        at a "high altitude," officials announced.

        The 48-foot rocket lifted off its
        launch pad and with 10 minutes
        the third stage, which would track
        down and destroy an incoming
        enemy ballistic missile, successfully
        ignited. Actual time of separation
        is classified.

        ## 'All Test Objectives'

        The Nike-Zeus and its electronic
        guidance components is the only
        free world weapon against an attacking
        ICBM.

        Officials said the Nike-Zeus met
        "all test objectives and all three
        stages fired."

        The first two stages of the package
        have nearly a half-million
        pounds of thrust. The third-stage
        power remained classified.

        There was no electronically simulated
        target used in the firing as
        has frequently been tested in the
        past.

        The Nike-Zeus does not have to
        make contact with its ICBM target
        but can destroy it if it comes
        within a lethal radius---a classified
        figure.

        Before the firing there was a
        short delay in the countdown.

        ## Third Time

        The launch was the third time
        all three stages of the anti-missile
        missile were tested at this
        coastal site. Previously one of
        the three stage firings was successful
        but the other was "less
        than totally successful."

        The usual plume of smoke appeared
        as the countdown neared
        zero. The missile was launched
        from an almost vertical position.

        The launch was the 13th Nike-Zeus
        firing from Point Mugu.

        Senate Space Committee unanimously
        approved $3,820,515,250 in
        authorizations for the civilian
        space agency including sums for
        extensive expansion of the Cape
        Canaveral space base.

        Included was $3,749,515,250 in
        authorizations for the year beginning
        July 1. That was $37,760,750
        less than the Administration had
        requested but some $78 million
        more than approved by the House.

        Earlier the committee requested
        detailed data on why astronaut
        Scott Carpenter floated on a
        raft for 90 minutes awaiting Navy
        helicopters while on Air Force flying
        boat, whose pilot was anxious
        to retrieve him, circled overhead.

        Six questions, posed by committee
        members at a hearing, were
        relayed to the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration and the
        Defense Department by Chairman
        Robert S. Kerr, D-Okla.

        The questions were submitted
        after D. Brainerd Holmes, NASA
        director of manned space flight,
        said he "detected no interservice
        rivalry" at the Cape Canaveral
        operations center where recovery
        operations were set in motion.

        Sen. Spessard L. Holland, D-Fla.,
        raised the rescue question.

        Holland said the Air Force
        Rescue Service at Orlando, Fla.,
        has confirmed that an SA16 flying
        boat circled Carpenter while paramedics
        and a raft were dropped
        to him. The plane, he said, was not
        ordered to rescue Carpenter, although
        the pilot of the plane
        evaluated the sea as calm and suitable
        for a landing.

        Holmes said Rear Adm John L.
        Chew, plotting the rescue on Carpenter's
        250-mile overshoot, "dispatched
        anything and everything
        this country had" to effect the
        rescue. Chew, he said, took the
        view that the plane should make
        the landing if the "people on the
        scene" felt that it would not be
        hazardous.

        However, Holmes was unable to
        say whether sea conditions had
        been evaluated on the scene as
        favorable or why Chew's directive
        was held up.

        Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev.,
        told Holmes he wanted to know to
        whom Chew's message was dispatched;
        who decided a sea landing
        was not safe, where that
        individual was when he made the
        decision, and why Chew's message
        was not relayed.

        Cannon said the Navy should
        also explain why an SA16 landing
        might be "hazardous" in a sea
        shown by photos to be calm.

        # Rocket Experts Haunted by Fear Of Lightning-Set Rocket Launch

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
        A blinding streak of lightning hits
        a tall missile just as tons of fuel
        are being transferred into it.

        An electrical storm prematurely
        triggers a rocket carrying a costly
        space capsule on its nose.

        It hasn't happened yet. But
        these ARE fears that have haunted
        the Air Force since it began running
        this test center a decade ago.

        Right now, the greatest concern
        is for missiles that use solid fuel.
        These are inclined to be sensitive
        and tricky. The Air Force says
        they could be highly vulnerable to
        lightning activity.

        For the future there is an even
        greater hazard --- liquid hydrogen
        and other new, high energy fuels
        that will go into tomorrow's spacecraft.

        Here at the heart of the U.S.
        space effort, the Thor, the Atlas,
        the Titan all stand high above the
        surrounding terrain when they are
        ready for launching. Even taller
        Saturn and Nova vehicles and
        their equally tall gantries---some 40
        stories high---are yet to come.

        Properly grounded, each serves
        as a highly effective lightning rod.
        But, even with grounding, the
        hazard persists.

        So says Lt Col Hal R. Montague
        of Mack, Colo., operations officer
        of the Air Force weather detachment
        that keeps constant watch on
        this treeless forest of high rockets.

        "It isn't the lightning itself that
        worries us so much. The real
        danger is that the current passing
        through the gantry might induce
        magnetic and electirc fields into
        the wiring and thus trigger the
        missile firing current.

        "Lightning has hit missiles at the
        Cape several times --- already at
        least once this year. None of the
        hits caused damage. But we have
        been lucky."

        The Air Force has not yet found
        a real safeguard against missile
        lightning strikes. But in mid-May
        it installed, at nearby Patrick Air
        Force Base overlooking Cape Canaveral,
        a newly-developed electrical
        storm warning device.

        Designed to alert crews around
        missile launching pads to any serious
        buildup of atmospheric electricity,
        the device received its first
        tryout during a brief but intense
        thunderstorm shortly after it was
        installed.

        ## Boston Developer

        Known as the Lightning Alert
        System, it was developed for the
        Air Force Meteorological Development
        Laboratory, Bedford, Mass.,
        by Arthur D. Little Co., Boston.

        If it proves effective, one part
        of the equipment may be installed
        at each launching pad here, to
        provide a warning for the immediate
        locality.

        The system would provide swift
        and accurate warning of incipient
        lightning hits so the missile crews
        could:

        ---Break off any hazardous fueling
        operation, and move fuel supplies
        to safe locations.

        ---Make sure the rocket is grounded
        adequately.

        ---Get out of the danger area.

        The system consists of two sensing
        devices on the roof of the
        operations building at Patrick Air
        Base. They feed their information
        about electrical content of the atmosphere
        into a metal box, resembling
        a radio cabinet, in the hangar
        office used by Montague and Lt Col
        Peter E. Romo, Phoenix, Ariz., detachment
        commander.

        Together the devices measure
        the potential buildup and decline
        of electrical energy in the atmosphere.

        # American, French Nike Outfits Given NATO Honors

        By HENRY B. KRAFT
        S&S Ramstein Bureau

        RAMSTEIN Germany (S&S)---An
        American Nike battery and a
        French Nike battalion, both located
        in Germany, have been judged
        the best Nike units in NATO and
        winners of the Spaak and Stikker
        trophies, according to an announcement
        made to 4th Allied Tactical
        Air Force (ATAF) by headquarters
        of Air Forces Central Europe
        (AIRCENT) at Fontainebleau,
        France.

        Competition sponsored by AIRCENT
        is conducted annually at
        a Nike missile firing range in New
        Mexico to determine the best
        NATO Nike battalion as well as
        the best Nike battery.

        D Btry, 3rd Bn, 71st Arty,
        located in the Stuttgart area, was
        judged the top Nike battery for
        scoring the highest number of
        points among all similar NATO
        Nike units which had been sent
        to New Mexico for actual firing of
        the missiles.

        This outfit, which belongs to the
        32nd Arty Brig, will be presented
        with the Paul-Henri Spaak trophy,
        named in honor of the former
        secretary-general of NATO, by Gen
        Samuel E. Anderson, deputy for
        air to Gen Lauris Norstad, Supreme
        Allied Commander in Europe
        on May 15.

        NATO Secretary-general Dirk U.
        Stikker will personally present the
        trophy named after him to the
        commander of the 520th French
        Nike Brigade, a component of
        fourth ATAF just like 32nd Arty,
        also on May 15, the announcement
        said. The French outfit topped all
        similar NATO Nike units in firing
        scores.

        Brig Gen Howard P. Persons Jr,
        CG of the 32nd Arty Brig, said
        in his headquarters in Kaiserslautern
        that he was proud of D Btry
        for winning such a coveted honor.

        "Not only did D Btry of the 71st
        Arty win first place, but B Btry,
        also of the 71st, won second place,"
        said the general. "We feel very
        proud of those people. Achieving
        the highest scores of all Nike batteries
        in NATO is really something."

        The trophies are donated by two
        American firms, Western Electric
        Co and Hughes Aircraft Co.

        # INTERCEPTION SUCCESS AT 16,000 MPH OVER PACIFIC

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT

        WASHINGTON, Thursday.

        AN American anti-missile missile, the Nike-Zeus,
        successfully intercepted an oncoming Atlas
        long-range missile over the Pacific to-day. The
        Defence Department announcement came three
        days after Mr. Khruschev's claim that Russia had
        anti-missile rockets which could "hit a fly in outer
        space."

        Mr. Sylvester, an Assistant Secretary of Defence, said
        to-day that he had no knowledge that Russia had ever
        matched to-day's test. He also said that he could not exclude
        the possibility.

        Mr. McNamara, Secretary of
        Defence, said he was confident
        that American missiles would be
        able to penetrate any anti-missile
        defence system "which
        has been developed by anyone."

        To-day's interception was carefully
        controlled and held in conditions
        that would hardly occur in
        wartime. The 48ft three-stage
        Nike-Zeus missile was fired from
        Kwajalein Island in the Pacific to
        intercept an Atlas launched from
        Vandenberg Air Force Base,
        California, 4,500 miles away.

        ## NOT NUCLEAR

        ## Warhead statement

        Neither missile had a nuclear
        warhead, but officials refused to say
        whether either carried conventional
        explosives. Normally both
        Atlas and Nike-Zeus have nuclear
        warheads.

        Interception occurred at a probable
        height of 600 miles. The
        Atlas would be moving at 16,000
        m.p.h.

        To-day's success does not mean
        America has achieved impregnable
        missile defences. But it gives the
        Army, which has spent over £400
        million on Nike-Zeus research and
        development, a strong claim on Mr.
        McNamara to put the weapon in
        quantity production.

        ## EARLIER DOUBTS

        ## Lukewarm attitude

        Mr. McNamara has been rather
        lukewarm towards Nike-Zeus.
        Early this year he spoke of
        "serious doubts" as to its practicability.
        He has so far refused
        to spend money on production as
        distinct from development.

        To-day he said merely that the
        test "evidences the extensive and
        continuing nature of the United
        States programme to understand
        the capabilities and limitations of
        anti-missile systems."

        The Defence Department said
        to-day that there had been a previous
        similar attempt to intercept
        an Atlas over the Pacific. It admitted
        that it "was not a complete
        success."

        WASHINGTON, Friday.

        ROUGHLY 50 more tests of the Nike-Zeus anti-missile
        missile are due in the next few months over the
        Pacific. In each case a £700,000 Atlas missile will be
        launched from California towards Kwajalein Atoll. As the
        tests progress they will be held
        under more and more realistic
        conditions.

        Decoys may be used in
        attempts to confuse the radar of
        the Nike Zeus. This will test
        its ability to "home" on its
        target.

        Mr. McNamara, Secretary of
        Defence, is evidently determined
        to wait until Nike-Zeus has proved
        itself in much more warlike conditions
        than those which existed
        yesterday before deciding whether
        to put the weapon into production.

        It would cost at least £3,500
        million to deploy the Nike-Zeus
        system in defence of the 27 main
        population centres of America
        alone. It would take perhaps four
        years.

        ## ARMY ENTHUSIASM

        ## No direct hit

        In contrast to Mr. McNamara's
        reserve, the Army and its friends
        in Congress are enthusiastic in
        their reaction to yesterday's feat.
        Some are calling it a great breakthrough
        in weapons development.

        Informed sources say the Nike-Zeus
        used yesterday did not
        actually hit the descending Atlas
        nose cone but it came close enough
        to have destroyed it if the defending
        rocket had had a nuclear warhead.

        Other anti-missile techniques are
        also being studied in the Pentagon.
        They include the possibility of
        launching missile interceptors from
        satellites. But Defence officials reported
        early this year that none of
        these methods had reached the
        "hardware" stage.

        ## RUSSIAN DEFENCES

        ## Penetration possible

        Despite Mr. Khruschev's claims,
        American Defence spokesmen
        doubt that Russia has an anti-missile
        system in deployment. Mr.
        McNamara said yesterday he was
        confident American missiles could
        penetrate Russian defences.

        It may well be, therefore, that
        for the next few years the only
        place on earth protected against
        missile attack will be Kwajalein.
        The atoll is a 602-acre dot in the
        Pacific seized from the Japanese in
        the last war.

        # Defense Weapon 'Hits' Rocket at 16,000 m.p.h.

        From Press Dispatches

        WASHINGTON---The first successful interception of an
        intercontinental ballistic missile by a U.S. Army Nike-Zeus
        antimissile was announced by the Defense Department.

        The interception was made by a Nike-Zeus fired from
        Kwajalein Island in the Central Pacific against an Atlas
        launched from California, 4,500 miles away. The Defense
        Department said an earlier
        test, at an undisclosed time,
        was "not a complete success."

        The interception announcement
        came as the Army disclosed it is
        planning missile tests over populated
        areas of the United States.
        They are scheduled to start in the
        middle of next year.

        It is doing so apparently because
        the White Sands missile range in
        New Mexico has been outgrown by
        the newer Army bombardment
        rockets.

        Issuing the historic military announcement
        of the interception,
        Assistant Defense Secretary Arthur
        Sylvester said he had "no
        knowledge" that Russia ever had
        made such an interception, although
        he could not deny the possibility.

        "Neither the intercepting missile
        nor the target carried a nuclear
        warhead. The intercept test used
        extremely precise tracking equipment,"
        the announcement said.

        The three-stage, 48-foot Nike-Zeus
        was fired from Kwajalein
        after its sensitive tracking equipment
        told it that the Air Force
        missile was plunging through
        space at 16,000 miles an hour at a
        probable altitude of 600 miles.

        Defense Secretary Robert S.
        McNamara issued a cautious statement
        about the antimissile in
        which he aimed a pointed barb at
        Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's
        claim last week that Russia
        has an antimissile missile which
        can hit a "fly in space."

        McNamara said the test "evidences
        the extensive and continuing
        nature of the U.S. program to
        understand the capabilities and
        limitations of antimissile systems."

        He then added pointedly, "It
        shows that we speak of such matters
        from knowledge."

        The defense secretary, who has
        been lukewarm about the Nike-Zeus,
        went on to say that the
        United States also is carrying out
        a program "to insure that our missiles
        will penetrate antimissile
        systems which might be encountered."

        These programs, McNamara said,
        "give us confidence that our missiles
        would be able to penetrate
        any such system which has been
        developed. . ."

        The Army, confident of the Zeus'
        potential for defending against missile
        attack, has spent $1.2 billion
        on development of the system.

        Space Committee Chairman
        George P. Miller announced the
        Zeus intercept to the House and
        called it evidence of "one of the
        greatest breakthroughs" in recent
        defense development.

        "The country that comes first in
        a defensive weapon (against missile
        attack) is in the driver's seat,"
        the California Democrat said.

        Asked why the previous shot,
        described as "not a complete success,"
        was kept secret until Thursday,
        Sylvester replied, "That is evident
        --- we had nothing to announce."

        Regarding the missile tests over
        populated areas, the Army said it
        is surveying three temporary missile
        launch sites in New Mexico
        and Utah from which it plans to
        shoot Pershing and Sergeant
        rockets into the White Sands
        range from as far as 300 miles
        away.

        The White Sands range is about
        100 miles long. The Pershing is
        built to shoot up to 300 miles. The
        Sergeant has a range of about
        75 miles.

        Test missiles do not carry nuclear
        or conventional explosive warheads.

        Army sources stressed that the
        Pershing and Sergeant rockets
        will pass over very sparsely
        populated areas with a density of
        about 1.5 persons a square mile.

        This country's other major missile
        test ranges are at Cape
        Canaveral, Fla., and along the
        California coast. From both places,
        test missiles are aimed out to sea.

        The Army surveys are being conducted
        near Blanding, Utah, some
        300 miles from White Sands, the
        Ft. Wingate ordnance depot in
        New Mexico, about 200 miles from
        White Sands, and an area southwest
        of Datil, N.M., about 70 miles
        from the present missile range.

        DOUBT has been cast on the future of Blue Water, the
        70-mile surface-to-surface guided missile under
        development by English Electric and designed to carry a
        British nuclear warhead.

        Doubts have arisen from the annual appraisal of defence
        expenditure by the Treasury, which takes place in June. This
        year's appraisal disclosed sharply rising costs within the next
        five years, and discussions on
        ways and means of off-setting
        these continued throughout July.

        Blue Water is among the
        threatened projects. It is due to
        start coming into service in 1964.
        The Defence Committee of the
        Cabinet is to meet again to-day.

        If work on Blue Water ceases,
        it will be solely for economy
        reasons. It would mean severely
        crippling and destroying the British
        missile industry and all that goes
        with it.

        ## 70-MILE RANGE

        ## British contribution

        Under current NATO plans
        Britain is required to provide a portion
        of the nuclear missiles in the
        70-mile range.

        This Britain would cease to do,
        and the Strategic Reserve would be
        without a local nuclear deterrent.

        If work on Blue Water is stopped
        there will be no question of buying
        Sergeant, the American replacement
        for Corporal which, though
        it will be in service a year earlier,
        is tactically inferior and more
        expensive.

        Blue Water missiles cost about
        £100,000 each, and Blue Water ancillary
        equipment, £250,000. Sergeant
        requires five vehicles, mostly
        larger and more complicated than
        the two required by Blue Water.

        Intended to replace the obsolete
        Corporal, with which two Royal
        Artillery regiments in Germany are
        armed, Blue Water is also designed
        to accompany the Strategic Reserve
        as a local deterrent.

        The missile is fired from a three-ton
        lorry after receiving orders
        from a computer carried in a long-based
        Land Rover.

        Blue Water can be carried in the
        Argosy, the tactical air transport
        coming into service. Three Blue
        Waters could be carried in the Belfast
        strategic freighter.

        ## ANGLO-FRENCH LINK

        ## Possible bearing

        The recently announced link-up
        of the British Aircraft Corporation
        with the French firm of Nord
        Aviation for joint research,
        development and production of
        guided missiles could have a bearing
        on the future of Blue Water.

        The Germans have accepted
        Sergeant. But there is reason to
        believe that both the French and
        the Dutch would be interested in
        Blue Water.

        The nuclear warhead, though
        of British manufacture, incorporates
        American "know-how" and
        the Americans will not agree to
        this being passed on.

        But in time the French could
        produce their own warhead,
        though not so the Dutch.

        The guidance system also has
        an element of American "know-how."
        But the Americans could
        hardly object, on military grounds,
        to this being passed on.

        # X15 Sets 47-Mile Altitude Record

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (AP) --- America's X15 plane
        rocketed more than 47 miles into
        space, achieved its designed altitude
        maximum and set a new altitude
        record in the process.

        Air Force Maj Robert M. White,
        holder of the X15 speed record of
        4,093 miles an hour, was at the
        controls.

        His altitude was given as 250,000
        feet --- precisely what he aimed
        for. His speed was approximately
        3,682 miles and hour.

        The little research plane's designed
        maximum attitude is 250,000
        feet. On a similar mission by space
        agency pilot Joe Walker last April
        the X15 fell a little short, hitting
        only 246,700 feet. In future flights,
        with the engine burning longer, it
        is expected to soar beyond 300,000.

        At the peak of his flight, White
        radioed: "Boy, what a view. Just
        tremendous." He was able to see
        for hundreds of miles.

        # X15 Passes New Heat Test Flight

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (AP)---The X15 rocket ship
        zipped through a heat test flight
        while 400 thermometers beneath
        its black skin checked temperatures
        hot enough to melt a conventional
        plane.

        It was research pilot John McKay's
        first trip aboard the sleek
        craft since installation of its powerful
        57,000-pound-thrust engine.
        His last flight was Feb. 1, 1960,
        when it was still powered by
        engines with 16,000 pounds of
        thrust.

        He hit 3,204 miles an hour and
        climbed to 83,000 feet for the test.

        Officials estimated the temperature
        reached 1,000 degrees on parts
        of the special steel-nickel alloy
        outer surface. Air friction made
        the ship hot enough to blister its
        black paint and run streaks of
        white through a special green
        thermal paint on parts of the fuselage.
        The edges of the tail and
        stubby wings turned red hot as did
        large flaps used for speed brakes
        at the rear of the 52-foot craft.

        ## Below Record

        But it was still below the 1,250
        degrees recorded on earlier flights.
        A conventional plane can go to
        about 400 degrees before its metal
        weakens.

        Prime purpose of the flight was
        to determine which parts of the
        X15's surface become hottest. This
        will aid in design of future aircraft.

        A secondary purpose of the
        flight was to reintroduce McKay
        to the souped-up X15 that has
        flown 4,159 m.p.h. and up to 250,000
        feet while he was on other assignments.

        NASA officials said the 400
        thermometers used were among
        600 heat sensors spotted under all
        surfaces of the ship. The others
        were not used Thursday. The 400
        in use sent electronic data to recording
        instruments in the craft.

        The X15 dropped away from
        under the wing of its B52 mother
        ship at an altitude of 45,000 feet
        at 10:41 a.m. It landed 9 minutes
        later.

        # X15 Skip-Glides to Earth in Roller-Coaster Dips

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (AP) --- X15 pilot Joe Walker
        streaked aloft at more than
        five times the speed of sound, then
        skip-glided back to earth here in a
        series of roller-coaster dips which
        returning spacecraft may copy
        some day.

        The powerful little rocket plane
        ordinarily comes in from space in
        a long, shallow glide, but Walker
        was experimenting with methods
        of braking descent speeds.

        After streaking to an altitude
        of 107,000 feet at speeds up to
        3,733 miles an hour, the veteran
        space agency pilot nosed over for a
        series of seven down-the-stairsteps
        hops.

        In the final two of these maneuvers,
        Walker slowed his speed from
        2,200 m.p.h. to 1,100 m.p.h. in 51
        seconds. The upcoming Dyna-Soar
        space glider is expected to use similar
        maneuvers in returning from
        orbit.

        Walker's purpose was to determine
        the stubby-winged space
        dart's maneuverability, not to set
        records. The X15 has twice reached
        a record altitude of 246,700 feet
        and previously had gone 4,159
        m.p.h.

        A secondary purpose was to test
        an electronic device which helps
        the pilot control the X15 at extreme
        speeds. The device, called a
        filter, automatically screens out
        unnecessary signals from his guidance
        system that otherwise might
        come too fast for him to handle.

        # X15 Tries Risky Space Maneuvers

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (AP) --- Rocketing a mile a
        second, X15 pilot Joe Walker
        swooped back to earth here on a
        miles-wide curve to pioneer a risky
        new landing maneuver for spacecraft.

        It was the first time the stubby-winged
        space dart has ever deviated
        much from a straight-as-an-arrow
        path during the main portion
        of a flight.

        The maneuver served to brake
        the X15's swift descent and subjected
        it to extreme aerodynamic
        stresses and heat from air friction.

        Walker hit a top speed of 3,716
        miles an hour on the way up to
        a peak altitude of 102,000 feet. He
        was not trying to exceed the X15's
        records of 4,093 m.p.h. and 246,7000
        feet---instead he was deliberately
        pushing the craft close to its structural
        limits.

        Over Daggett, Calif., he swung
        westward in an arc that extended
        some 50 miles southeast of the
        170-mile direct line between launch
        point and this base.

        Nearing home, he spiraled downward
        in a further speed-braking
        maneuver and touched down after
        an 8-minute flight.

        Future spaceships will need this
        broad maneuverability to pick their
        landing sites as they scream back
        from the moon and other planets.

        ## White Joins the Astronauts

        # X15 Climbs to 58 Miles

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (AP) --- U.S. X15 pilot Robert
        M. White flashed a record 58 miles
        into space to become the first to
        qualify as an astronaut in a winged
        craft.

        White surpassed the rocket
        research plane's old altitude mark
        by about 12 miles.

        "This is a fantastic view," he
        radioed exultantly as he floated
        weightless at peak altitude. "This
        is absolutely. . . ."

        At that point, interference
        blotted out his words.

        His feat makes him the fifth
        American entitled to wear the
        wings of an astronaut, which go
        to those who vault 50 miles or
        more above the earth. The others,
        who qualified with flights in Mercury
        space capsules, are Alan
        Shepard, Virgil Grissom, John
        Glenn Jr. and Scott Carpenter.

        White's altitude was given officially
        as 310,000 feet. This compares
        with 246,700 feet achieved
        earlier by both White and test
        pilot Joseph M. Walker in flights
        aimed at reaching the X15's
        designed maximum altitude of 250,000
        feet.

        White's target altitude was 282,000
        feet, and he substantially exceeded
        it because his speed was
        284 miles an hour faster than
        planned.

        Future flights are expected to
        reach still higher, 75 miles or more.

        The 38-year-old test pilot hit
        3,784 m.p.h. during his climb. The
        X15 speed record is 4,159 m.p.h.

        Another of the space agency's
        X15s --- this one experimenting
        with methods of descent---streaked
        aloft at more than five times the
        speed of sound. (See story on
        Page 3.)

        ## Washington Honors

        Later White flew into Washington
        for a White House ceremony
        at which he and three fellow X15
        pilots were to be honored for outstanding
        achievements in aviation.

        At the White House President
        Kennedy was to present the Robert
        J. Collier Trophy for the outstanding
        aviation achievement of
        1961 to the X15 test pilots.

        White, his wife, and X15 pilot
        Joseph A. Walker of the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        flew to Washington from
        here.

        The other test pilots to be honored
        at Wednesday's ceremony
        were Navy Cmdr Forrest Petersen
        and A. Scott Crossfield of North
        American Aviation Co.

        A U.S. Air Force pilot flew
        an X 15 rocket plane to
        a new record height of more
        than 58 miles today.

        And he became the first man to
        win astronaut's wings for
        winged flight.

        The pilot, Major Robert White,
        smashed his target of 282,000ft.
        by 28,000ft. The reason: His
        speed of 3,784 m.p.h. was 284
        m.p.h. faster than planned.

        When he landed he said it was
        a "remarkable, wonderful
        flight."

        "I could see more clearly than
        ever before the distinct curvature
        of the earth's urface. The
        sky was a deep, dark blue and
        I could see the light area along
        the horizon very well."

        ## Floating paper

        He also said he had seen an
        object which looked like a
        floating piece of paper at his
        peak altitude.

        [U.S. spaceman John Glenn said
        he saw objects resembling
        "fireflies" on his space flight
        and Russia's Major Titov reported
        seeing specks resembling
        snowflakes during
        his orbits.]

        The new record was given officially
        as 310,000ft. The old
        record was 246,700ft., set up by
        Major White and test pilot Joe
        Walker.

        Before the flight by Major
        White only four U.S. astronauts
        had won the wings for
        exceeding an altitude of 50
        miles in wingless space rockets.

        MAJOR ROBERT WHITE of the United States Air
        Force flew an X-15 rocket plane to-day to a world-record
        height of 58 miles, which is more than the distance
        from London to Cambridge. He became the first pilot of
        a winged plane to qualify as an astronaut.

        To-day's height, which was officially given as 310,000ft,
        is about 12 miles further than the previous record, 246,000ft.
        This was set up in both April
        and June this year.

        Because any flight of 50 miles or
        higher qualifies the pilot as an
        astronaut, Major White will be the
        fifth American entitled to wear the
        "space wings." The others are
        astronauts Cdr. Alan Shepard,
        Capt. Virgil Grissom, Lt.-Col. John
        Glenn and Lt.-Cdr. Scott Carpenter.

        ## 41deg. CLIMB

        ## Steepest attempted

        The X-15 was dropped from a
        B-52 bomber high over Delemar,
        Nevada. Major White held the
        57,000lb-thrust engine fully open
        for 80sec and went into a 41deg.
        climb, the steepest yet attempted
        by the plane.

        He substantially exceeded his
        target height of 282,000ft because
        his speed during the climb was
        280 m.p.h faster than planned. On
        levelling out at the top he
        experienced weightlessness for
        three minutes.

        During descent to Edwards Air
        Force base, California, he put the
        plane through tests as it re-entered
        the earth's atmosphere. These
        involved lifting its nose and falling
        "spread-eagle" style to slow the
        descent.

        ## Object in space

        Major White reported seeing a
        strange object, like a piece of
        paper, adrift in space at the top of
        his climb. "I have no idea what
        it could be. It was greyish in
        colour and about 30 to 40ft away."

        # 7 USAREUR Battalions to Use Missile Range in British Isles

        WASHINGTON (Special) --- The
        Defense Department and the British
        War Office in London announced
        Friday that arrangements have
        been made for use of a British missile
        range in the Hebrides Islands,
        off the west coast of Scotland, by
        seven USAREUR Corporal missile
        battalions.

        The agreement was made in
        accordance with the North Atlantic
        Treaty Organization principle that
        a NATO country should make available
        to other NATO countries, if
        possible, an extra capacity on its
        firing ranges.

        ## Expanded Program

        Last summer, one U.S. Army
        Corporal unit used the Hebrides
        range for its practice firing. The
        success of that firing was instrumental
        in the expanded program
        this year.

        From June through August,
        seven Corporal battalions of USAREUR's
        7th Army and Southern
        European Task Force (SETAF) will
        move to the Hebrides range one at
        a time for their annual service
        practice.

        Besides lending its firing range
        to the American units, the British
        Army will also provide certain
        equipment and support personnel.

        Annual practice missile firing is
        a routine training requirement.
        Until the Hebrides range was made
        available by the British, American
        missile units were required to return
        to the United States for the
        firing.

        Use of the Hebrides range will
        save time and money, provide an
        excellent training exercise for support
        personnel and permit firing
        under European climatic conditions,
        American officials said.

        # MISSILE OBSOLETE BY 1963

        By Air Cdre. E. M. DONALDSON, Daily Telegraph Air Staff

        THE United States will take over the Russian targets
        now assigned to the British-based Thor medium-ranged
        nuclear ballistic missiles when they come off their pads next year. American authorities, disclosing this yesterday,
        added that "the basis of the
        British action was financial."

        They suggested the money
        may be used to strengthen our
        conventional forces in Europe.

        Financial considerations are
        obviously paramount in any military
        expenditure. But the reason
        Britain is to scrap the Thor missile
        deterrent is because it will be
        useless by next year.

        ## LIMITED RANGE

        ## Polaris build-up

        Thor's limited range prohibited
        its use against the heart of Russia
        from anywhere but European
        bases. Britain was chosen by
        America as the only secure European
        base from secrets and defence
        points of view.

        Russia's rapid development of
        devastating intermediate-range
        nuclear rockets has made Thor
        obsolete. The Americans say Thor
        will be out of operation by October
        next year.

        By that time the number of
        United States atomic submarines
        with Polaris missiles will have increased
        from nine to 17. As each
        submarine carries 16 missiles, the
        deterrent value will be more than
        doubled.

        In the same period, America's
        6,000-mile range intercontinental
        ballistic missile force will have increased
        from the present 81 to
        more than 480 missiles.

        Britain's military leaders are convinced
        that conventional forces
        cannot stop Russian aggression in
        Europe. Any move to increase
        conventional forces at the cost of
        nuclear power will be firmly
        resisted.

        # THOR AIRMEN PRAISED

        ## C.-IN-C.'s MESSAGE

        By Our Air Staff

        The decision to phase out the
        Thor Force of Bomber Command
        in no way detracted from the vital
        role which the force had played in
        the past, Air Marshal Sir Kenneth
        Cross, C.-in-C. Bomber Command,
        said in a message to the four Thor
        stations yesterday.

        "You in the Thor force have
        maintained a constant vigil day and
        night for almost four years," he
        said. "I am content that history
        will recognise your devoted service
        in the cause of peace."

        Mr. Hugh Fraser, Secretary for
        Air, sent a message of appreciation
        to Bomber Command yesterday.
        "The high state of readiness at
        which the Thor force has been
        maintained, the record of serviceability
        sustained and the success
        achieved with combat training
        launches reflect the greatest credit
        on all concerned," he said.

        # ROCKETS MAY AID BRITISH SATELLITES

        By ANTHONY SMITH, Daily Telegraph Science Correspondent

        THE announcement that the
        60 Thor rockets, now in
        eastern quarter of England,
        are to cease being operational
        next year has interested
        various groups in Britain who
        would like to have them.

        At present neither Britain, nor
        the European Launcher Development
        Association, has a large
        rocket capable of working as the
        first stage of a satellite launcher.
        Blue Streak's engines have been
        tested in Britain, but the rocket has
        not yet been fired at Woomera.

        The Thors are well-tried rockets.
        Presumably they will be still in
        first class condition on the day they
        are disbanded, despite their five
        years on the airfields of Yorkshire,
        Lincolnshire and East Anglia.

        They could be shipped to Australia
        and used as first stages for
        launchers. By themselves, despite
        their 1,500 to 2,000 mile range, they
        could not launch a satellite.

        ## TELSTAR IN ORBIT

        It would be necessary to add at
        least one extra stage to them before
        they could orbit anything. The
        Americans have been using Thors
        modified in this way recently, and
        Telstar went into orbit on a Thor-Agena
        B rocket.

        The Minister of Defence, Mr.
        Thorneycroft, did not say what
        would happen to Britain's Thors
        when he announced that they would
        no longer be operational. They
        were all flown to this country, one
        at a time, in huge transport aircraft.

        If Britain is allowed to use the
        rockets, she could start launching
        satellites of her own far sooner than
        intended. The rapid progress with
        communication satellites, well
        demonstrated by Telstar, has shown
        that Britain is in danger of being
        left out in the cold in this field.

        The Americans have not yet
        demanded a return of the missiles.
        But, even if they do, there is a case
        for suggesting they are not returned,
        but are used instead for the
        peaceful exploration of space.

        # THOR BASES IN BRITAIN CLOSE IN 1963

        ## END OF PACT WITH AMERICA

        ## RELIANCE ON V-BOMBERS

        By Air Cdre. E. M. DONALDSON, Daily Telegraph Air Staff

        THE five-year agreement
        with the United States to
        station Thor missiles in
        Britain is not to be extended
        and will end during next year.
        This was announced by Mr.
        Thorneycroft, Minister of
        Defence, in the Commons
        yesterday.

        There are 60 Thors in operational
        readiness in England.
        Fifteen each are based at Driffield,
        Yorks, Henswell, Lincs, North
        Luffenham, Rutland, and Feltwell,
        Norfolk.

        They cannot be fired without
        United States permission. A senior
        American officer is stationed at
        each base with a key to unlock the
        missile before it can be fired.

        Thor's performance has been
        considerably improved in the last
        12 months. It now has a range of
        2,000 miles and carries a two
        megaton American-made warhead.

        It can be fired in less than 15
        minutes of a warning. A new version
        with a solid fuel motor could
        be fired instantaneously.

        The system cost the United
        States £68 million and Britain
        spent £12 million on the sites,
        communications and training of
        personnel. The sites now cost a
        total of between £4 and £5 million
        a year to keep operational.

        ## V-BOMBER POWER

        ## Stand-off bombs

        Britain is too small and vulnerable
        to a surprise and concentrated
        nuclear attack and too near
        potential enemies to rely on a
        static deterrent.

        This means that Britain will
        now rely completely on V-bomber
        force for the deterrent after next
        year. This can get airborne and
        out of trouble in about 90 seconds
        after an alert and can be recalled
        should it be a false alarm

        RAF Bomber Command has re-equipped
        with the Mark 2 version
        of the Vulcan and Victor. Blue
        Steel, the stand-off bomb, is now
        becoming operational.

        This bomb has a range of several
        hundred miles and can be launched
        from outside heavily defended
        areas. It flies at several times the
        speed of sound at very high altitude.

        Russia would have no defence
        against Blue Steel until at least by
        1965 by which time Sky Bolt, the
        airborne ballistic missile will be
        ready for Bomber Command. There
        is no known defence against this
        missile, which can be fired from
        anywhere.

        ## THOR'S FUTURE

        ## American use

        The Minister's statement disclosed
        that Thor now has a two
        megaton warhead. This must mean
        that Blue Steel and Sky Bolt will
        have at least as much destructive
        power. This is double what has
        been estimated up to now.

        The future of the Thor missiles
        still has to be decided. They will
        probably be returned to America.

        The Americans have a continued
        use for them as satellite launchers.
        It was the Thor missile that took
        the "Rainbow" bomb aloft during
        the recent Pacific tests.

        # Nuclear Heating Planned for Moon Travelers

        WASHINGTON (AP)---The
        Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)
        is developing a nuclear-powered
        heating unit for spacecraft landings
        on the often-frigid moon.

        AEC Chairman Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg
        said commission scientists
        were working on a special generator
        in the so-called SNAP series---that
        is, systems for nuclear auxiliary
        power. Earlier versions are
        in use in some satellites as sources
        of power for instruments.

        The one under development is
        called SNAP-11. It's designed for
        a special job in the civilian space
        agency's Surveyor Program --- the
        venture aimed at exploring the
        moon's surface with unmanned
        spacecraft beginning in 1964.

        Seaborg said the generator, using
        radioactive curium-242 as fuel,
        would be designed to act as a continuous
        source of electrical power
        for radios and other instruments
        aboard a Surveyor craft. Also, he
        said, it "will be able to provide heat
        to the Surveyor craft during the
        cold lunar night."

        He made only a brief reference
        to the project in a talk prepared
        for a meeting of the Washington,
        D.C., post of the American Ordnance
        Association, but the implications
        are these:

        Each Surveyor craft will carry
        four television cameras designed to
        snoop on the moon's surface and
        transmit pictures back to earth.

        And, without SNAP-11 on the
        job, the TV cameras and other
        sensitive scientific gear would have
        tough sledding in an environment
        where the night temperature
        stands at around 240-degrees below
        zero Fahrenheit --- and the length
        of the lunar night is equal to 14½
        earth days.

        While Seaborg did not say so,
        the implication was clear that
        some kind of SNAP unit would
        also be employed to keep things
        comfortable inside manned spacecraft
        when they land on the moon.

        Elsewhere in his talk, Seaborg
        said he believed nuclear energy as
        a propulsion source --- as distinguished
        from an auxiliary electrical
        source --- could "provide the most
        feasible means of accomplishing
        long voyages in space and many
        other of our more ambitious space
        missions."

        Speaking of the nation's Rover
        Project --- aimed at developing
        nuclear-powered rocket engines ---
        Seaborg said it was reasonable to
        expect the first flight test during
        1966.

        # My rockets, by Nasser

        EGYPTIANS tested four
        single-stage rockets in the
        Western Desert yesterday, then
        President Nasser told reporters
        they could land "just south of
        Beirut"---apparently meaning
        Israel.

        The rockets, he said, were
        made entirely in the United
        Arab Republic, and they had
        plenty, or else they "would not
        have been able to spare four
        for tests."

        # Egypt fires a rocket

        From Our Own Correspondent CAIRO, Saturday.

        At a rocket base in the western
        desert President Nasser to-day
        watched the launching of Egypt's
        first rocket. It reportedly reached
        its target area 400 miles away.

        Journalists grouped six miles
        from the firing base saw four
        rockets fired. Pres. Nasser came
        from the launching site to tell the
        journalists that the rockets were
        Egyptian made and were in mass
        production.

        ## NEGEV EXERCISES

        From Our Own Correspondent TEL AVIV, Monday.

        Israel has not asked the West
        for missiles to offset Egypt's
        rockets, according to Tel Aviv
        reports. But diplomats are
        believed to be considering a discreet
        review of the Middle East
        arms situation.

        The pointed negative attitude of
        the United States in granting
        operational missiles to smaller
        nations and the consequent difficulties
        Israel is bound to meet
        when applying for missiles is being
        stressed in Tel Aviv.

        Gen. Meir Amit, Army Intelligence
        Chief said to-day that Israel
        had the names of a considerable
        number of foreign experts who
        developed the Egyptian rocket and
        assembled it mainly from imported
        parts. Israeli intelligence believes
        the Egyptian picture is exaggerated.

        Meanwhile Israel is staging what
        is considered to be her most important
        artillery exercises this year
        in the Negev. Armour and
        infantry are taking part.

        CAIRO (UPI)---Israel remains the United Arab Republic's No. 1
        enemy as this nation enters the second decade of President Gamal
        Abdel Nasser's revolution.

        Nasser, then an army lieutenant colonel, led a dozen other young
        officers in a revolt against the corrupt civil government of King
        Farouk 10 years ago Tuesday, sending the confused and luxury-sated
        king into European exile.

        Egyptians are celebrating the anniversary with a week of parades,
        fireworks, and ceremonies. Peasants in their long striped galabiyahs
        and headdresses have been crowding Nasser's capital for many days.

        But the high point of the celebration came two days before the
        anniversary date on an Egyptian missile test site 50 miles from Cairo,
        a 20th Century establishment less than an hour's drive from the
        Pyramids.

        There the U.A.R. entered the space age, in the presence of Nasser
        and the foreign press.

        It fired four single-stage rockets and Nasser announced that they
        were now "in large-scale production---otherwise we couldn't have spared
        the four for testing."

        It was clear from his other remarks how closely Egypt's unfinished
        war with Israel is linked with the rockets and other military developments.

        "The only military significance is the range they reach," Nasser told
        newsmen. Asked their exact range, he said: "A little south of Beirut"---a
        reference to Israel, which lies to the south of Lebanon.

        The rocket have a range of from 235 to 372 miles. Tel Aviv is 250
        airline miles from Cairo.

        Although Nasser quarrels with some of his Arab neighbors, their
        enmity toward Israel is one thing all agree on. With the French
        Algerian war at an end, observers believe new efforts will be made
        to concentrate attention on the Israel issue.

        These other developments were in the forefront as the U.A.R. marked
        10 years under Nasser:

        ---The moves toward creation of a socialist state. More than $840
        million worth of private property has been nationalized since the last
        anniversary.

        ---The change in approach to Arab unity. From dreams of one united
        Arab state, the emphasis now seems to be aiming for eventual but
        gradual federation.

        Syria's withdrawal last September from the 3½-year-old union under
        Nasser has had serious repercussions around the Middle East. But it
        has not been the political disaster to Nasser's prestige that some observers
        predicted.

        Syria has escaped the stringent socialist measures Nasser had planned
        for it, but the price has been political chaos. Cairo papers have been
        giving daily attention to reports of Syrian government attempts to
        crush pro-union elements.

        CAIRO, Sunday.

        REACTION throughout the Arab world to-day shows
        that Egyptian prestige has soared after yesterday's
        successful demonstration of rocket firing. Commentators
        in most Arab capitals have been quick to point out that
        Israel is within the range
        claimed for the Egyptian
        rockets.

        President Nasser has said the
        rockets are now in mass production
        in Egypt. Successful tests
        were held 14 months ago.

        Yesterday's firing of four rockets
        in the Western Desert was watched
        by President Nasser, Government
        Ministers, foreign officials and
        diplomats. It was a dramatic prelude
        for the 10th anniversary of
        the revolution that overthrew King
        Farouk.

        ## 400 MILE RANGE

        ## "Historical achievement"

        President Nasser toured laboratories
        and factories where the
        rockets were built before watching
        the firing. Four one-stage rockets
        were launched.

        Two were Conquerors, 40ft missiles
        with a range of nearly 400
        miles. The others were smaller,
        Victors, with a range of about 250
        miles.

        President Nasser later spoke to
        journalists who watched the firing
        from a six-mile distance. He indicated
        that work was taking place
        on rockets with greater ranges.

        Mr. Hassouna, Arab League
        Secretary-General, discribed the
        firings as "a decisive historical
        achievement in evolution and a
        measure for consolidating Arab
        strength and ensuring the safety
        and advancement of the Arab
        world."

        ## £10m nuclear scheme

        Mr. Sharabassy, Public Works
        Minister, announced last night that
        £10 million has been set aside for
        the building of Egypt's first nuclear
        power plant.

        # First round in the battle to get world communication into the space age

        By JOHN DAVY Our Science Correspondent

        ON Tuesday the Telstar
        communications satellite
        is due to be launched from
        Cape Canaveral.

        Later this month it will relay the
        first TV programme ever transmitted
        direct across the Atlantic. A
        huge 340-ton horn antenna at
        Andover, Maine, will beam signals
        at the satellite, which will
        rebroadcast them to be picked up
        by the G.P.O.'s big dish on Goonhilly
        Down, Cornwall.

        For 10 minutes, viewers all over
        Europe will be treated to brief
        glimpses of the American way of
        life---shots of principal cities, a
        look at Labrador, Fords at Detroit
        and glimpses of Canadian and
        Mexican borders.

        ## More convenient

        For another 10 minutes, American
        viewers will enjoy a lightning
        tour of Europe, set up through the
        European Broadcasting Union, and
        piped to Cornwall to be beamed at
        the satellite from Goonhilly Down.
        The British contribution to the programme
        is expected to include
        shots of the Houses of Parliament
        and the Atlantic pounding the
        rocks at Land's End.

        At first the satellite's orbit will
        not be appropriate for transatlantic
        broadcasting. Then, later in the
        month, it will hurtle rapidly over
        the necessary part of the Atlantic
        in the early hours of the morning---"not
        really peak viewing time,"
        one G.P.O. official comments.

        Assuming that the satellite continues
        to function, its orbit will
        gradually become more convenient
        for viewers. However, its purpose
        is not to encourage mutual geography
        lessons for Americans and
        Europeans, but to provide some
        thorough tests of this new means
        of long-distance communications
        which promises to become of
        immense commercial importance.

        ## Gold plate

        This accounts for the fact that
        the costs of developing and launching
        Telstar are being met entirely
        by the American Telephone and
        Telegraph Company. It is virtually
        the first entry of private enterprise
        into space.

        The satellite itself, developed at
        the Bell Telephone Laboratories, is
        a remarkable three-foot sphere
        tricked out with platinum,
        sapphire and gold plate, and filled
        with pink plastic foam.

        It weighs 170 lb., and its outer
        surface is formed by 72 flat facets.
        Most of these facets contain solar
        cells to generate electricity from
        sunlight, mounted in a platinum
        frame and covered with a protected
        plate of transparent sapphire. Some
        facets house a mirror which will
        catch the sun in space and reflect
        a bright flash to earth to aid tracking.

        ## Radio command

        The electronic equipment is
        housed inside a 20-in. canister suspended
        inside the sphere on nylon
        cords and bedded in pink plastic
        foam to absorb vibration and
        shock.

        It is probably the most powerful
        receiver, transmitter and amplifier
        for its size and weight in the world.
        It could relay 60 simultaneous
        two-way telephone conversations,
        600 one-way voice channels or a
        one-way television programme.

        Telstar's egg-shaped orbit will be
        tilted at 45 degrees to the
        Equator, its nearest point 500 miles
        and its furthest point 3,000 miles
        above the earth. It will circle the
        earth every two hours 40 minutes.

        Besides its relay equipment, Telstar
        contains devices which enable
        it to be switched on and off by
        radio command from the earth,
        and a battery of instruments to
        monitor both radiation in space
        and its own innards.

        This is one of the most important
        parts of the Telstar experiment,
        because radiations in space are for
        electronic engineers what moisture
        and smog are for civil engineers on
        earth. Both make vital materials
        gradually deteriorate.

        One of the biggest question-marks
        hanging over communications
        satellites is how reliable they
        will be---and Telstar will be able to
        provide a kind of running commentary
        on its own gradual senescence.

        Telstar is only one of many
        possible types of communications
        satellite. There is much debate at
        the moment about the best solution.
        One plan is to launch lots of
        small, relatively cheap satellites at
        low altitudes, and replace them
        steadily. Another is to establish a
        large, expensive satellite 22,300
        miles above the Equator.

        At this height, it would circle at
        the same speed as the earth
        revolves, and would thus appear to
        hang stationary in the sky. Established
        over the Atlantic, it could
        serve most of North and South
        America, and Europe, 24 hours a
        day. Three such satellites could
        serve the whole world except the
        Poles.

        ## A snag

        One snag is that they would be
        very expensive to build and launch,
        and a "spare" would have to be
        established in orbit near each one
        in case of failure. There would
        be perceptible delays because of
        the distance radio waves would
        have to travel, and this could make
        conversations awkward.

        But America's National Aeronautics
        and Space Agency is planning
        to test these problems with
        Syncom, a high-altitude "synchronous"
        satellite of this type, to
        be launched during the next year.
        (A low-altitude satellite similar to
        Telstar, Project Relay, will also be
        launched this summer.)

        ## High frequencies

        If communications satellites can
        be made reliable, they offer huge
        increases in transmission capacity,
        and very good quality. At present,
        only 80 simultaneous telephone
        conversations can be carried on
        through the cables linking Britain
        with America and Canada. An
        operational satellite system might
        immediately multiply this capacity
        at least 20 times. A single large
        high-altitude satellite might multiply
        telephone capacity between
        Europe and America 45 times.

        All these satellites will use very
        high frequencies, which pierce
        straight through the ionosphere and
        are thus not normally vulnerable to
        magnetic storms, fading and blackouts.
        In theory, at least, excellent
        quality should be possible.

        All this might suggest that communications
        satellites are a 24-carat
        gold mine. But there are commercial
        as well as technical question-marks.
        The main one is whether
        the demand for transoceanic telephones
        and television will increase
        to make full use of the huge new
        capacity.

        ## Underlined

        If it does not, communications
        satellites will be hard put to it to
        compete with submarine cables.
        This is underlined in a recent study
        undertaken for the space agency by
        William Meckling, a Rand Corporation
        economist.

        Mr. Meckling studied two possible
        systems: one, a system using
        a large number of small low-orbit
        satellites, together with 13 ground
        stations round the world; second,
        a large, high-altitude "synchronous"
        satellite stationed over the
        Atlantic. He took into account
        costs of manufacture and launching,
        operating ground stations, and
        various degrees of reliability in
        both satellite and launching rocket.

        In the first case, he found that if
        the average life of each satellite
        was two years, and three launches
        out of four were successful, $8,500
        per year would have to be charged
        for each voice channel, assuming
        that all 7,800 channels available
        were sold.

        But if use expanded only gradually
        to fill the capacity, the costs
        would be much higher. Assuming,
        for instance, that 1,000 channels
        were sold in the first year, and sales
        increased after this by 15 per cent.
        a year, the annual charge a channel
        would have to be $24,000---or three
        times as much.

        ## More marginal

        However, on these assumptions,
        the satellite system could still compete
        with cables: the annual cost
        of a voice channel through a 3,000-mile
        cable link Meckling estimates
        as some $27,000. But the advantage
        is much more marginal---and
        if the average life of each satellite
        is only one year rather than two,
        the chances of matching cable costs
        are poor at present.

        However, most experts agree that
        it will be two years or more before
        really reliable estimates of the commercial
        prospects will become possible.

        It is to be expected that costs of
        building and launching communications
        satellites will fall---but submarine
        cable technology is not
        standing still either, and cable
        engineers will obviously fight hard
        to get their costs down too.

        The situation is strikingly similar
        to atomic power. No one doubts
        that it will become economic
        sooner or later---but estimates of
        the "break-even" date vary. Telstar
        is the beginning of what will
        be a long and elaborate development
        programme.

        # NO SATELLITE "DOMINATION"

        From Our Own Correspondent WASHINGTON, Friday.

        Mr. Robert Kennedy, the
        Attorney-General, said to-day he
        had fought to prevent domination
        of the proposed commercial communications
        satellite system by one
        company or a group of large firms.
        He felt there was no such danger
        in the compromise Bill now before
        Congress.

        The President's brother was
        speaking to the Senate Foreign
        Relations Committee as it opened
        an inquiry into the foreign policy
        implications of the Bill. Senator
        Morse, Democrat, of Oregon, and
        the Bill's principal opponent, is
        chiefly concerned with their
        domestic effects.

        # TELSTAR IN ORBIT

        JUST 24 hours after the space-rending explosion
        over the Pacific comes a fresh launching from Cape
        Canaveral which everyone can applaud without
        reserve. Telstar is no spy-in-the-sky, still less an
        engine of destruction or intimidation, but simply a
        radio relay station. Its military innocence is
        emphasised by the fact that this is a commercial
        private enterprise---like the first faint pulses of
        wireless telegraphy which MARCONI sent across the
        Atlantic 61 years ago. Physically, too, Telstar spins
        above the nuclear fray. Messages and television
        pictures transmitted through it will escape the
        periodic hazards of sunspot interference; nor can
        man, as his skill now stands, shoot it down or black
        it out.

        Little effort of imagination is required to appreciate
        the technical promise of this new instrument
        of communication. World-wide exchange of television
        programmes is only the most immediately
        spectacular of its possibilities. The immense easing
        and speeding of ordinary commercial and personal
        communications may prove of greater solid value.
        Some dozens of Telstars may be needed to afford
        a continuous service; but this pioneer alone provides
        600 single-voice channels, besides the transmission
        of sound and television. Technology has shrunk
        still further the One World already with us. Nobody
        in the free part of it can doubt that such expansion
        of communications will make for better understanding
        in the other half; but the prospect lays heavier
        responsibilities on the communicators, especially in
        the field of television.

        # RECEPTION STEADY

        By Our TV and Radio Correspondent

        BBC viewers saw a "live"
        panorama of New York City via
        the Telstar satellite for 10 minutes
        last night. Richard Dimbleby gave
        a commentary from Rockefeller
        Plaza, Manhattan.

        The pictures were steady and
        free from interference, but slightly
        muzzy. They came promptly at
        8.20 p.m. as planned, to form an
        introduction to the regular
        "Panorama" programme.

        None of the passers-by caught by
        the camera seemed to realise that
        their images were being flashed
        across the Atlantic. One had the
        feeling that already the marvel of
        Telstar had become commonplace.

        After filmed items from America
        and a sequence about the Common
        Market, some muzzy pictures of
        Mr. Dimbleby returned. This may
        have suggested to some that all the
        American material came direct via
        the satellite; but, in fact, these last
        few moments were recorded.

        # TELSTAR SIGNALS LOUD & CLEAR

        ## American TV satellite safely in orbit

        ## 'LIVE PICTURES' AIM FOR BRITAIN

        TELSTAR, the forerunner of a satellite system that
        will make regular transatlantic television
        possible, went into orbit yesterday from Cape
        Canaveral, Florida. Engineers in Britain prepared to
        receive American TV "live" picture signals relayed
        by it within hours of the launching.

        On its fifth and sixth orbits a receiver at
        Goonhilly Downs, Cornwall, got ready to pick up its
        sound and vision signals, for retransmission by the
        BBC, which kept its television going until 1.30 a.m.

        American officials said Telstar was "functioning
        beautifully," sending back "loud and clear signals."
        Twelve hours after launching they said it was
        "right on the button," in a near-perfect orbit.

        The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has
        spent £17 million on the project, including £1 million paid to
        the Government for launching facilities. The satellite is
        intended to improve telephone communications, as well as
        relay TV transmissions both ways across the Atlantic.

        # PMG's HOPES OF FUTURE SATELLITES

        BY OUR OWN REPRESENTATIVE
        WESTMINSTER, Tuesday.

        BRITAIN will not be left out
        in the cold when a system
        of satellite communications
        becomes operational, Mr.
        BEVINS, Postmaster-General,
        assured the House of Commons
        at question time to-day.

        Asked to enlarge on this point,
        he said it was almost certain that
        there would be such a system in
        seven or 10 years and "we as a
        country hope to participate." In
        the course of time a second system
        might be designed and we might
        participate.

        In the first of a series of questions
        about Telstar, Mr. W. R.
        WILLIAMS (Lab., Openshaw) had
        asked about Britain's financial
        contribution. Mr. BEVINS said it
        was an American project paid for
        by the American Telegraph and
        Telephone Co.

        Shocked that we had no direct
        interest, Mr. WILLIAMS pointed
        out that this country was in the
        forefront of all other technical telephonic
        developments.

        "I don't think it surprising when
        one compares the relative resources
        of the United States and ourselves",
        insisted Mr. BEVINS. It
        did not follow that we should have
        no stake in future development.

        In a written reply Mr. Bevins
        stated that it was expected that the
        Post Office would spend about
        £700,000 in the year 1962-63 on
        the development of communications
        by artificial satellites.

        # BRITAIN'S POSITION

        By Our Science Correspondent

        The Postmaster-General, Mr.
        Bevins, was asked by M.P.s yesterday
        about the British contribution
        to the Telstar communications
        satellite, and the fact that
        Britain is using the satellite rent
        free.

        He replied that Britain would
        also be getting the next satellite
        rent free. Scientists and engineers
        had been busy working out ideas
        for a British satellite, but "you
        cannot have a British satellite
        system unless you have a launching
        rocket."

        So far Britain has contributed
        very little to the project, for the
        Goonhilly apparatus in Cornwall
        cost £750,000. The American
        company involved with Telstar has
        already spent £20 million.

        # BRITAIN SEES PICTURES FROM FRENCH RECEIVER

        By L. MARSLAND GANDER, Daily Telegraph Television and Radio Correspondent

        VIEWERS in Britain saw yesterday on their home screens the
        excellence of the pictures received in Brittany from across
        the Atlantic, via the Telstar satellite. They were of
        unbelievably good quality, showing three American engineers
        discussing results as clearly as if
        they were in a local studio.

        The pictures received at the
        British Post Office station at Goonhilly
        Downs, Cornwall, on this first
        night of experiment, were far less
        satisfactory, being jumpy, blurred
        and torn.

        It was ironical that during the
        evening, to fill in, the BBC had
        shown pictures of the first transatlantic
        television, achieved in 1928
        by Baird on 30 lines. Those at
        Goonhilly were not much better.

        ## STILL NO SOUND

        Early yesterday morning the BBC
        showed a recording of further pictures
        received off the satellite's
        seventh orbit. These were hailed
        by Raymond Baxter, the commentator,
        as a big improvement, but were
        in fact only slightly better than
        those seen earlier, and there was
        still no sound.

        The French receiving station at
        Pleumeur Boudou, near Lannion, is
        using equipment similar to that at
        Andover, Maine. It includes a big
        horn-shaped aerial, which contrasts
        with the open 85ft dish of the Post
        Office-designed station at Goonhilly.

        It is altogether premature to
        decide that one system is better
        than the other. The Post Office
        station was being used for the first
        time, whereas the Americans have
        had considerable experience with
        their type of receiver, used in conjunction
        with satellites.

        A Post Office spokesman said
        yesterday: "The aerial needed
        small adjustments but there are no
        real bugs. Engineers were betting
        four to one against receiving anything
        at all on the first night.

        "The tracking data was fully up
        to expectations and the aerial
        tracked perfectly. To say that the
        first night results were a failure is
        quite wrong. It was a limited
        success."

        At the Goonhilly station yesterday
        engineers were climbing on the
        aerial to make changes for another
        attempt to see a picture as good as
        that picked up in France.

        These alterations, it was stated,
        brought the aerial back to its
        original adjustment, before it was
        altered last week-end in accordance
        with inforamtion received from
        America.

        Before the first experiments the
        Post Office had emphasised that the
        £750,000 station, built in a year,
        was less costly than the so-called
        Earth Station at Andover, Maine,
        with its Radome that houses the
        great rotating horn antenna, duplicated
        by the French.

        ## DOUBT ON CAUSE

        ## "Not explicable"

        OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
        writes: The Post Office and the
        engineers at the Goonhilly receiving
        station in Cornwall are confident
        that both the equipment and
        their skill are good enough to pick
        up satisfactory television signals
        being relayed from the Telstar
        satellite. But it may take a little
        time.

        Officials at the General Post
        Office in London gave no clear
        answer yesterday to questions concerning
        the poor reception of
        yesterday morning's first attempt.
        They said that minor adjustments
        were necessary, but would not describe
        them.

        One man said they were highly
        technical and not explicable. The
        Post Office team were listening in
        again last night and were hopeful of
        improving their technique still
        further.

        The Post Office also said the fault
        did not lie with the tracking for
        "that was perfect." The difficulty
        lay in the reception and amplification
        of the faint signals.

        # TELSTAR COST PROHIBITIVE

        ## Too much for the 'Voice of America'

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        WASHINGTON, Monday.

        MR. ED MURROW, director
        of the United States
        Information Agency, pointed
        to-day to the "prohibitive
        cost" of using the proposed
        American communications
        satellite system for "Voice
        of America" programmes.

        To broadcast 1½ hours of television
        a day to the seven major
        areas of the world now served, he
        said, would cost more than £320
        million a year at commercial rates.
        This was more than eight times the
        total present budget of his agency.

        He urged that since the Government
        had invested so much in communications
        satellites it should
        enjoy preferential rates. Mr.
        Murrow, a television commentator
        in London during the blitz, was
        speaking to the Senate Foreign
        Relations Committee.

        ## FULL SAFEGUARDS

        It is studying the implications
        of President Kennedy's Bill to set
        up a Commercial Communications
        Satellite Corporation to own and
        operate the system under government
        regulations. Mr. Rusk, Secretary
        of State, a later witness, said
        the Bill provided full safeguards
        for American foreign policy.

        He declared: "There is unquestionably
        an advantage for the
        United States in moving rapidly
        to establish an effective system in
        which other nations may participate
        and which, we may hope, will
        soon have global coverage.

        He knew of no country which
        had refused to do business with a
        private American communications
        firm. He did not think the proposed
        corporation would impede
        the necessary international cooperation.

        # TELSTAR TO BE "RETIRED" IN TWO YEARS

        By ANTHONY SMITH, Daily Telegraph Science Correspondent

        TELSTAR, the satellite
        which has been active for
        the past four weeks in relaying
        television across the
        Atlantic, will be "retired" as
        obsolete in two years.

        It is moving in a wide ellipse,
        varying in height between 3,454
        and 579 miles above the Earth and
        it is estimated that it will do so
        for 200 years. Perhaps when space
        rendezvous techniques have been
        developed, some astronaut will pick
        up this historic object.

        Telstar's solar cells should still
        be charging its batteries, but a
        command from Earth will put the
        satellite out of action. It is expected
        that by the summer of 1964
        various other communications
        satellites will have rendered Telstar
        superfluous.

        ## VISIBLE SATELLITE

        Another long-timer in space is
        the Echo satellite, the one for
        which times of passing are regularly
        given in THE DAILY TELEGRAPH
        beneath the weather chart. On
        Sunday, Echo will have been up for
        exactly two years. Originally it was
        a shiny balloon, inflated to a
        diameter of 100 feet, and easily
        visible.

        Since then its surface has been
        crinkled, and its diameter has been
        reduced. But it is still the brightest
        satellite to be seen, because of its
        size, and is likely to remain so until
        Echo II is launched, probably in
        October.

        At the last count, which was
        made by the United States, it was
        announced that 49 satellites were
        in orbit round the Earth. This
        figure discounts all the bits and
        pieces of rocketry, the satellite casings
        and so on, which are
        incidental to the satellite.

        ## KEEPING TRACK

        Of these 49 satellites, 41 are
        American and eight are Russian.
        The Americans keep track of all
        satellites, which must be a major
        task, even when they have ceased
        transmitting.

        They do this by a sort of radar
        screen which stretches across the
        country. When any satellite passes
        over the line of this screen, it is
        detected.

        Satellites launched into equatorial
        orbits would miss it, for they
        would never come as far north as
        latitude 30deg N, the rough position
        of the screen. So far no Russian
        satellite has been fired into anything
        approaching an equatorial
        orbit, partly because their launch
        sites are so far from the equator.

        success for tests made on Wednesday
        night and the early hours
        of yesterday morning of television
        across the Atlantic.
        According to these reports, the
        pictures of objects and faces
        transmitted by wireless from a
        room in the heart of London
        were actually seen, though somewhat
        imperfectly, on the other
        side of the ocean."

        Which Wednesday is that? Last
        Wednesday, or the one before? Or
        was it a Wednesday 34 years ago?

        The quotation is, in fact, taken
        from THE DAILY TELEGRAPH of
        Feb. 10, 1928.

        The remarkable John Logie
        Baird had pulled off a fantastic
        experiment, and everyone learnt of
        the impoverished Scottish inventor.
        An image of the face of Mrs. Mia
        Howe, and various other people,
        had been transmitted across the
        Atlantic and picked up at Hartsdale,
        a suburb of New York.

        This was no freak transmission,
        as occasionally happens in the
        world of radio. It was the culmination
        of a year of work, and a king-sized
        feather in the cap of Mr.
        Baird, the 39-year-old "father" of
        television.

        Four men were watching the
        receiver in Hartsdale when the historic
        picture came through. Two
        of them were from the newly
        founded Baird Company, one was
        the owner of the Hartsdale station,
        and the fourth was from Reuters.
        The picture they saw appeared on
        a piece of ground glass, which
        measured two inches by three.

        Transmission began at midnight,
        London time, and 7 p.m. New York
        time. At first a ventriloquist's
        dummy was placed before the
        "camera" to give those in New
        York time to adjust their receiving
        apparatus.

        The image of the dummy was
        first sent by telephone line to
        Coulsdon, and then transmitted
        across the Atlantic on a wavelength
        of 45 metres. The ionosphere
        bounced the signals back again,
        and the receiver at Hartsdale
        picked them up.

        When the dummy was satisfactorily
        tuned in, a message was
        transmitted from New York to
        London asking that others should
        replace it. Various people, including
        Mrs. Howe, a reporter,
        and Mr. Baird himself, took their
        turns, moving their heads about
        as they did so. Britain's first
        transatlantic television pictures
        arrived, hesitantly, on the other
        side.

        In fact, although Baird customarily
        gets the credit for being
        first, some Americans had pipped
        him at the post by a few weeks and
        had also sent a crude picture across
        the ocean. But Baird is Britain's
        television hero and the Americans
        are conveniently forgotten in
        Britain.

        Baird should, by rights, have
        gone from strength to strength.
        Certainly one month later he pulled
        off a similar coup by sending a
        picture of Dora Selvy from London
        to the Berengaria, 1,000 miles out
        at sea. And three years later he
        transmitted the Derby. In 1932
        he repeated the feat, and 4,000
        people in London watched the race
        without getting nearer Epsom than
        the Metropole cinema at Victoria.

        Unfortunately, like so many inventors,
        Baird was just as capable
        of rushing up blind alleys as of
        opening up great new highways of
        technology.

        He put most of his faith in a
        system of television known as a
        mechanical scanner, and he made
        it work. But, when the time came
        for broadcasting committees to
        choose a system, they chose electronic
        scanners.

        And when television was created
        as a public service, no one could
        send signals across the Atlantic. A
        proper picture required a short
        wavelength and a very high frequency,
        which means that the
        ionosphere cannot bounce it back.
        Baird's transmissions to America
        had been possible only because of
        the long wavelength he had used,
        and because the ionosphere can
        bounce such waves back again.

        The very short wavelengths had
        to be used in general television
        practice mainly because television
        is a demanding medium. It uses up
        a great deal of the bandwidth and
        therefore had to be relegated to
        the ultra-short wave part of the
        radio spectrum.

        Transmissions had to be "line-of-sight"
        only, for there was
        nothing to reflect them back from
        their straight courses. Nothing,
        that is until Telstar came along.
        The satellite is just something to
        bounce the waves back to earth.

        # Twin U.S. Spaceships to Seek Out Secrets of Venus

        CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
        An interplanetary spaceship
        named Mariner I is scheduled for
        launching here Saturday on a 3½-month
        journey to the vicinity of
        the planet Venus.

        If successful, the intricate spacecraft
        will zip within 10,000 miles
        of Venus in early November and
        sensitive instruments will probe
        secrets of the cloud-veiled planet.

        Before Mariner I covers the 36
        million miles to Venus, Mariner
        II, scheduled for launching within
        6 weeks, is to be following the
        same course through space.

        Purpose of the double launching
        is to gather as much data as possible
        in the brief 6-week period
        when Venus is in a favorable position.
        It will be another 19 months
        before earth and Venus again will
        be in relative positions, in their
        orbits about the sun, for another
        shot.

        ## Russian Attempt

        U.S. scientists anticipate Russia
        also will launch a vehicle toward
        Venus in the present period.

        The Russians launched the only
        previous Venus probe, but its
        radio equipment failed long before
        it reached the vicinity of Venus.
        They estimated it passed within
        62,000 miles of the bright planet
        and went into orbit around the
        sun---just as Mariners I and II are
        expected to do.

        An Atlas-Agena B rocket will
        start the 446-pound Mariner I on
        its space voyage. Using the same
        technique which enabled Ranger
        IV to hit the moon earlier this
        year, the Agena B will settle into
        a so-called "parking orbit" 115
        miles above the earth at a speed of
        18,000 miles an hour.

        When the Agena B is in proper
        position for a Venus trajectory,
        its engine will accelerate to a speed
        of 25,700 m.p.h and kick the spacecraft
        free of the earth's gravitational
        pull.

        A complex system of earth and
        sun sensors, gyroscopes and gas
        jets will keep Mariner on course
        and in the proper tilt so its instruments
        can radio data back to
        earth. Its solar panels will gather
        the sun's rays for battery power.

        The main tracking station at the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration's facility at Goldstone,
        Calif., will issue necessary
        radio commands to alter trajectory
        when necessary.

        About eight days after launching,
        when Mariner I is more than
        2 million miles from earth, Goldstone
        will send a signal to fire an
        engine in the spacecraft. This mid-course
        engine can produce 50
        pounds of thrust for up to 43
        seconds and will provide the big
        boost needed to jockey the vehicle
        onto the path toward Venus.

        Mariner I resembles a giant insect
        with its solar cell paddles
        spreading to a span of 16½ feet.
        Arrayed along the 12-foot central
        body are tubular and dish-like antennas,
        instrument containers,
        transmitters, fuel tanks and other
        specially designed devices.

        The craft carries seven scientific
        experiments.

        Five are to collect information
        in interplanetary space between
        earth and Venus.

        The other two will provide information
        solely on Venus and will
        scan the planet for a 30-minute
        period when Mariner I will whiz
        past at more than 90,000 m.p.h.

        The Venus experiments include
        a microwave radiometer to study
        composition of the atmosphere and
        surface temperature and an infrared
        radiometer to record temperatures
        in the atmosphere.

        Other experiments will measure
        the strength of interplanetary and
        Venus magnetic fields; high-energy
        radiation; solar plasma --- charged
        particles streaming from the sun;
        cosmic dust, and the rate at which
        charged particles lose energy.

        The studies could provide clues
        to the dangers man faces in space
        flight. But of more immediate interest,
        they may begin stripping
        some of the secrets from mysterious
        Venus.

        Although Venus is earth's closest
        planetary neighbor, little is known
        about it because the surface is continually
        masked by dense clouds.

        Scientists doubt that life exists
        on Venus, but don't know for sure.

        Mariner I and the Venus craft to
        follow could answer many of these
        riddles.

        # U.S. SHOOTS AT VENUS THIS WEEKEND

        From Daily Mail Reporter
        NEW YORK, Tuesday.

        A SPACE-ROCKET to the
        planet Venus is to be
        launched by the United
        States this weekend.

        The rocket---called Mariner I---will,
        it is hoped, "graze"
        Venus and send back information
        about the planet's atmosphere.

        The 125,000,000-mile journey
        through space will take three
        and a half months.

        Mariner I will be launched
        from Cape Canaveral, probably
        on Saturday. It will be followed
        six weeks later by Mariner II.

        American scientists are planning
        to miss Venus by about
        16,000 miles in order not to contaminate
        the planet.

        Venus, which is about the
        same size as Earth, is one of the
        solar system's biggest mysteries.
        It is perpetually shrouded in
        clouds.

        No one knows whether the
        clouds are formed by water, in
        which case there might be life
        on Venus, or by perpetual dust
        storms, which would make the
        temperature about 600 degrees
        Fahrenheit---far too hot for life.

        U.S. scientists expect that
        Russia will also launch a rocket
        to Venus during this period.
        Russia has already tried once,
        but the rocket's radio equipment
        failed.

        # Venus rocket fails

        Trouble with the booster rocket
        early yesterday forced postponement
        of an attempt to launch a
        Mariner I spacecraft from Cape
        Canaveral to unveil some of the
        mysteries of the planet Venus.
        Another attempt will be made

        # VENUS ROCKET FAULT TRACED

        ## COMPUTER TO BLAME

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Friday.

        Somebody's mistake in working
        out the "programme" fed into an
        electronic computer caused last
        Sunday's failure of the Atlas-Agena
        rocket, carrying instruments to collect
        information on Venus, a
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Agency official said to-day.

        The destroyed rocket and its instruments
        were worth £7 million.
        Another attempt will be made in
        the middle of August.

        If the computer had been properly
        "programmed" it would
        have been possible to continue controlling
        the flight of the rocket
        after a brief routine interruption
        of radio contact. The error meant
        it was not possible to regain control
        and the rocket was blown up
        deliberately.

        # U.S. Venus-Probe Rocket Destroyed After 5 Minutes

        CAPE CANAVERAL (AP)---A
        U.S. rocket bound for Venus wandered
        off course and was destroyed
        by the range safety officer five
        minutes after it blasted off into the
        predawn sky.

        The explosion high above the
        Atlantic ruined the first U.S. efforts
        to propel a spacecraft to the
        vicinity of Venus to probe secrets
        of the cloud-shrouded planet.

        The craft, named Mariner I, was
        to pass within 10,000 miles of Venus
        in early December.

        The explosion occurred about the
        time the second stage was to fire
        on Sunday.

        "Cause of the malfunction was
        not immediately known," NASA
        said.

        The Atlas-Agena combination
        has worked several times in the
        past --- and successfully launched
        the Ranger 3 and 4 moon shots
        earlier this year.

        NASA has scheduled two Mariner
        shots in a 50-day period to take
        advantage of a time when Venus
        is in a favorable position. Officials
        said a minimum of 24 days will be
        required to prepare Mariner II for
        launch.

        The only previous Venus probe
        was launched by Russian scientists.
        It passed within 62,000 miles of the
        planet but provided no scientific
        data because its radios fizzled.

        # VENUS ROCKET COSTING £4m. ENDS IN SEA

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        NEW YORK, Sunday.

        AMERICAN technicians at
        Cape Canaveral were trying
        to-day to find out the
        cause of a fault in the guidance
        system of an Atlas Agena B
        rocket. It had to be destroyed
        shortly after starting its flight
        towards Venus to-day.

        The range safety officer pressed
        the destruction button because the
        rocket "Mariner I" was deviating
        slightly from its prescribed course.
        As he did so there was a brilliant
        flash. Spectators at the Cape
        watched as equipment valued at
        £4,280,000 plunged into the
        Atlantic.

        Mariner I was to have travelled
        through space for 139 days to
        within 10,000 miles of Venus. Cape
        Canaveral officials said to-day they
        hope to learn what went wrong
        before they try a second Mariner
        shot.

        This should take place within
        the next few weeks. After Sept. 10
        it will be 19 months before Venus
        is again in a favourable position for
        a space probe from earth.

        AMERICA'S next man into orbit was picked last
        night. He is Walter Schirra (pronounced
        Shi-RAH), aged 39. And for him, a six-orbit trip is
        lined up.

        The exact date has not yet been fixed, but blast-off will be
        late this summer. The mission will break important new
        ground.

        1---A six-orbit shot will mean that the Spaceman
        will come down in the Pacific instead of the
        Atlantic.

        2---It may answer an absorbing question about
        health in Space---does something happen
        around the sixth orbit to make astronauts sick?

        Soviet Spaceman Titov, who spent a day in Space
        last August, became sick the sixth time round.

        ## Quiet

        This could mean that weightlessness for around nine
        hours, the time it takes for six orbits, has an effect on
        the body's balance-control mechanism that becomes intolerable.

        Brown-haired, brown-eyed Wally Schirra, known
        down at Cape Canaveral as "the quiet one" of the
        seven US astronauts, is
        married, with a son and a
        daughter.

        He comes of a flying-mad
        family. His father and
        mother toured America
        after World War One (in
        which Schirra senior was
        an air ace) in a light
        plane, giving daredevil
        displays.

        ## Combat

        Spaceman Schirra inherited
        their skill. In
        Korea he flew ninety
        combat missions, downing
        one Soviet-built MiG
        fighter and probably destroying
        a second.

        If he can come back
        from Space with six of the
        best, it will mean that, before
        the end of the year,
        America can mount an
        eighteen-orbit mission---and
        catch up with the
        Russians.

        ## 'Bonus'

        Last night, Mr. D. Brainerd
        Holmes, Director of
        the Manned Space Flight
        Division of the National
        Aeronautics and Space
        Administration, said:
        "Anything over three
        orbits would be considered
        a bonus."

        But six was the target.

        # TV PICTURE FROM SATELLITE

        WASHINGTON, Friday.

        THE U.S. Air Force announces
        that the United
        States has used an orbiting
        communications satellite to
        transmit T.V. pictures.

        The experiment was disclosed
        as the House of Representatives
        approved legislation
        to speed up the development of
        satellites that will one day relay
        regular T.V. programmes
        round the world. The Bill now
        goes to senate.

        Last week's TV signals were
        bounced off the two-year-old
        Echo 1 satellite about 1,000
        miles above the earth at the
        time. The satellite successfully
        reflected pictures of a cowboy
        and a trained seal to a point
        2,500 miles from the transmitter.---BUP.

        # 13 satellites for GPO

        ## PROPOSAL FROM FARNBOROUGH

        By an Air Correspondent

        The Royal Aircraft Establishment
        at Farnborough has proposed a
        system of satellites in circular orbits
        over the equator to meet future
        communication requirements specified
        by the GPO.

        Although the ideal orbital height
        would be 9,000 nautical miles, a height
        of 6,000 nautical miles would be
        acceptable initially and would enable
        the forthcoming European space
        launching vehicle based on Blue Streak
        to be used. Before such a system
        could be operational, however, a new
        launching site would need to be built
        near the equator.

        These are among the details of
        British Communication satellite plans
        which are disclosed in an article in
        today's issue of "Flight" magazine.
        The heart of the RAE plan is its design
        for an extremely simple satellite,
        weighing some 400lb. and looking
        rather like a spiky, four-bladed paddle-wheel.
        Solar cells cover the four
        paddles, two of which carry electronics
        equipment at their ends.

        ## Initial cost

        To develop this satellite to a usable
        form would cost about £20 millions,
        including nine launchings. The initial
        capital cost for an operational system
        would total about £84 millions, of which
        £20 millions would be for the construction
        of a launching site, £4.5
        millions for three guidance stations,
        £24 millions for 16 communication
        ground stations, £200,000 each for 21
        satellites, and £31.5 millions for 21
        launchings.

        Thirteen satellites in orbit at 6,000
        miles, it is calculated, would provide
        an acceptable operational system for
        worldwide communication. The difference
        between 13 and the 21 satellites
        assumed in the cost estimates represents
        an allowance to cover unsuccessful
        launching attempts.

        At least five years would be needed
        to complete the development programme
        and reach the stage of launching
        the first operational satellite. The
        European launching vehicle, however,
        is not likely to be available before
        1967 to begin development launches,
        and a total time of seven years to an
        operational system is more likely.

        Satellites in orbits around the poles
        were considered, but rejected because
        of the technical difficulty of "station-keeping"
        while in orbit. Station-keeping
        for the equatorial system chosen
        would be simpler. Another alternative,
        employing a large number of
        satellites in random orbits, was rejected
        because of complexity and cost.

        Ideally, the GPO wanted each
        satellite to be capable of handling about
        1,000 telephone circuits plus two television
        channels. But the RAE conclude
        that this requirement cannot be
        met, using the first version of the
        European launching vehicle. Improved
        versions of the rocket might make this
        possible later, however.

        # THREE MORE "TELSTARS" BY JULY PLANNED

        ## JAPAN OLYMPICS TV RELAY TO EUROPE POSSIBLE

        From L. MARSLAND GANDER,
        Daily Telegraph Television and Radio Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Sunday.

        TELSTAR and three more communications satellites, called
        Relay, will be in orbit by next July if the present plans
        materialise. They will make possible, theoretically, four or
        five hours of transatlantic television relaying in every 24 hours.

        Relays to Europe of the Olympic Games from Japan in 1964
        may be achieved. This is the main subject to be considered by
        54 delegates from 19 European countries who assemble in New
        York to-morrow. It is the first meeting of the European Broadcasting
        Union to be held in the
        United States.

        The delegates were invited by
        the American associate members
        of the Union, chiefly the three big
        networks, the American Broadcasting
        Company, the Columbia Broadcasting
        System, and the National
        Broadcasting Company.

        The Mayor, Mr. Wagner, will
        welcome the delegates at their
        opening meeting in the Waldorf
        Astoria. The chairman will be Mr.
        Olaf Rydbeck, president of the
        Union and Director-General of
        the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation.

        ## DECEMBER LAUNCHING

        ## Complicated problems

        The projected firing of the first
        of the new Relay satellites, of the
        Radio Corporation of America due
        in the first week of December, has
        greatly increased the importance of
        the meeting.

        It is hoped to thrash out during
        the week some of the complicated
        legal, technical, financial, programme
        and copyright problems
        arising from these potential extensions
        of transatlantic live television.
        So far European television organisations
        have not paid for Telstar
        transmissions which have been regarded
        as experimental.

        Relay will be four times as
        powerful as Telstar using 10 watts
        and each satellite will make eight
        orbits daily. But Telstar's orbits
        will be unfavourable for transatlantic
        programming from late this
        month till early January.

        ## BRITISH DELEGATE

        ## Secret meetings

        The BBC is strongly represented
        at the meeting. Mr. Edward Pawley,
        who is head of the Engineering
        Services Group, is chairman of the
        Union's Technical Committee.
        Mrs. Joanna Spicer, head of BBC
        television programme planning, is
        chairman of the Union's Programme
        Planning Group. Mr.
        E. C. Robbins, BBC legal adviser,
        is also attending.

        Representing the Independent
        Television Authority and network
        are Mr. Bernard Sendall, the
        Deputy Director-General, and Mr.
        Howard Thomas, the chairman of
        the Independent Television Contractors'
        Association.

        After the first open plenary
        session to-morrow there will be a
        series of private committee meetings.
        They will be as secret as a
        summit conference.

        On Wednesday the delegates will
        be guests of the United States Information
        Agency in Washington
        and will probably attend the
        President's Press conference. Their
        last meeting will be on Friday. On
        Saturday they will visit the satellites
        tracking station at Andover,
        Maine.

        # VENUS STUDY IN OCTOBER

        ## JODRELL BANK

        Jodrell Bank is to make another
        experiment on Venus starting in
        October and lasting until about
        Christmas. Equipment was being
        transported up the 300ft-high telescope
        yesterday.

        It is proposed to study the rate
        of rotation of the planet and to
        make a measurement of the solar
        system. Venus is 26 million miles
        away at it closest to the earth.

        In the last experiment in April
        last year echoes were bounced off
        Venus. It takes two and a half
        minutes for an echo to reach the
        planet.

        Dr. J. Thompson, head of the experiment,
        said the surfaces of the
        planet would be investigated. These
        were believed to be smoother than
        has been thought.

        ## SATELLITE SENT UP

        ## Missile launching

        THE American Air Force
        launced a satellite with a
        Thor-Agena D booster from Vandenberg
        air base, California, to-day.
        As in previous launchings of Samos
        and Midas "spy-in-the-sky" reconnaissance
        satellites, no details were
        released.

        A Titan 2 missile was successfully
        launched from Cape
        Canaveral to-day on a 5,000-mile
        flight. It is being developed as
        America's most powerful military
        rocket and as booster for the
        Gemini and Dyna-Soar manned
        spacecraft.

        BASE, Calif. (UPI)---The Air Force
        has announced the launching of a
        secret satellite, believed to be
        another in the Discoverer series.

        The Air Force, in keeping with
        its policy of blacking out details
        of such firings, merely said in a
        terse statement that a satellite employing
        a Thor-Agena B combination
        had been launched.

        # POLARIS "NEAR DISASTER"

        ## OUT OF CONTROL

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Friday.

        A United States Air Force
        spokesman admitted to-day that
        there could have been a disaster
        yesterday when a large section of
        a Polaris missile from Cape Canaveral
        escaped destruction and went
        out of control.

        Orders to destroy the Polaris,
        which was without a nuclear
        device, were given by the range
        safety officer when it began twisting
        wildly during a test flight. The
        section escaped and dropped into
        the Atlantic.

        The safety officer said that the
        Command Destruct system had
        worked properly. One report stated
        that the missile was not wired
        properly for complete detonation.

        At least three Soviet cosmonauts are going to
        be sent together to land on the moon
        according to Lieut.-Colonel Yuri Gagarin in a
        statement released through the Soviet News
        Service in London today.

        Forecasting the way
        Russia will assault the
        moon the pioneer spaceman---now
        commander of
        Russia's Cosmonaut
        Squadron---says that after
        robot sputniks have
        explored the lunar face big
        transport rockets will
        dump stocks of food, fuel
        and tools there.

        Pre-fabricated parts from
        which huts can be built---made
        of lightweight foam
        metal---are also likely to be
        sent ahead of men.

        "Only a well-prepared
        team will be able to fulfil
        the task of making the initial
        study of this 'difficult' planet
        which is heated to 120 degrees
        Centigrade in daytime and
        cooled to minus 150 degrees
        at night," adds Gagarin.

        "Men will need, of course,
        special insulated clothing to
        be able to appear on the
        surface."

        ## Maths in orbit

        Fresh detail about Russia's
        double space flight, also released
        today, reveals that Major
        Nikolayev spent nearly a week
        inside a Vostok space ship on
        the ground before he was passed
        fit for the 1,500,000 mile trip.
        Doctors watched him throughout
        for signs of a mental breakdown.

        To test the effects of weightlessness
        the cosmonauts had to
        do complicated mathematics,
        recognise geometrical figures,
        tot up horizontal and vertical
        columns of numbers and enter
        their answers in a log book while
        they orbited the world.

        Comment from their doctors
        today on the spacemen's
        appetites: "The only thing that
        makes them eat during a three
        or four day flight is---nervousness."

        RUSSIA sent her third spaceman into orbit at 8.30 a.m. (G.M.T.) yesterday.
        Communist sources in Moscow estimate that the spaceship will be up
        for 2½ to three days, which will mean between 30 and 50 orbits. The
        astronaut, Major Andrian Nikolayev, 32, a former lumberjack, guided the
        spaceship during part of yesterday's flight and at 7 p.m. went to sleep
        "according to planned schedule."

        Russia yesterday asked the United States to
        refrain from holding high altitude nuclear tests
        that might endanger the spaceman's safety. The
        State Department in Washington last night said
        they wished Major Nikolayev well and they
        contemplated no activities that would interfere
        with him.

        Fifteen minutes after take-off Major Nikolayev radioed
        back to base: "Everything is normal aboard. The earth is
        clearly visible through the porthole." Moscow Radio
        estimated at 7 p.m. that Major Nikolayev had completed
        more than seven orbits and travelled 186,059 miles. His
        speed was 18,000 miles an hour.

        The astronaut's voice was
        picked up by the Jodrell Bank
        radio astronomy station as the
        spaceship, Vostock 3, was on its
        second orbit, and a message on
        its fourth.

        Moscow reports said the spaceman
        was successfully completing
        the programme of experiments and
        feeling fine. He ate three times
        yesterday, including one meal of
        "natural" food. Previous spacemen,
        Russian and American, have
        had their food from tubes.

        ## Complete surprise

        The launching came as a complete
        surprise and without the
        inspired leaks that preceded early
        Soviet space flights. It is just over
        a year since Major Gherman Titov
        went into space for 17 orbits, lasting
        a little over a day.

        According to corrected data
        released in Moscow, at 4 p.m. the
        spaceship was orbiting the earth
        at 88.32min. a full circle as compared
        with 88.5min. at the early
        part of the flight.

        Its perigee had changed from
        the initial 114.37 miles to 112.5
        miles and the apogee to 146.25
        miles as compared with 156.87
        miles.

        Major Nikolayev's orbit time
        means that his spaceship is bound
        to re-enter the atmosphere within
        a few days.

        But no manned spacecraft has so
        far had a lower altitude as high as
        114 miles, and he could well stay
        up for longer than Titov.

        No one has been in space for
        anything like the time that Titov
        was. Major Gagarin, his predecessor
        by four months, made only one
        orbit. The two Americans, who
        both orbited this year, were each in
        space for less than five hours.

        There has so far been no information
        about the weight of the
        spaceship. Gagarin and Titov
        orbited in spaceships of about 4½
        tons, but the Russians have also
        failed to publish the weight of their
        recent "Cosmos" series of research
        satellites.

        Had the United States made a
        high-altitude nuclear test the sudden
        liberation of radiation on an
        orbiting spaceman might have been
        dangerous. The last high American
        test was at 200 miles, or rather
        higher than Major Nikolayev, and
        the next is likely to be higher still.

        ## Complex tasks

        The official Russian news agency
        said last night: "Flying over various
        parts of the globe Major
        Nikolayev transmitted greetings to
        the peoples of our motherland and
        of the Socialist countries, as well
        as to the peoples of Africa, Latin
        America and the United States.

        "In the 10½ hours of his stay in
        space, pilot cosmonaut Nikolayev
        fulfilled complex tasks. He systematically
        checked the state of the
        systems and units of the ship,
        carried out corrections and adjustments.

        "On instructions from the earth,
        carried out visual observations
        through the cabin portholes. The
        cosmonaut clearly saw islands,
        rivers, lakes and settlements."

        In accordance with the flight
        programme, Nikolayev twice
        switched over to manual control of
        the ship. At this, the orientation
        of the ship was effected normally.

        ## Moved around

        "To study workability in conditions
        of weightlessness the cosmonaut
        left his seat and moved
        around in the cabin. According to
        Major Nikolayev's reports, workability
        is preserved."

        A simple aerial, not the huge
        telescope itself, at Jodrell Bank
        picked up the voice of Major
        Nikolayev. Contact was made with
        the spacecraft only a few minutes
        after the frequency waveband on
        which its transmitter is operating
        (20.006 and 143.625 megacycles)
        was received.

        A message from Major Nikolayev,
        picked up at Jodrell Bank at 2.30
        p.m. (GMT), when the spacesship
        was on its fourth orbit, was translated
        by two Russian students
        there. It said: "All is going
        according to schedule, I am well."

        One of the students said the
        spaceman identified himself as
        "Sokol," which meant "Falcon."
        The students were going to a
        cricket match, but agreed to help
        with translation of messages.

        Sir Bernard Lovell said that the
        significance of this new successful
        Soviet flight will only become
        apparent when the duration of the
        flight is known. "If, as seems
        likely, the flight should last several
        days, then this would represent a
        rapid stride in the Russian attempt
        to get a man on the moon."

        Sir Bernard Lovell said later
        that the Russians would have the
        option every morning either of
        bringing him back to earth or
        allowing him to continue circling.
        The choice was every morning
        because Soviet territory would then
        be in a suitable position, relative
        to the orbit, for his return.

        The timetable of events for the
        space flight is as follows (all times
        G.M.T.).

        8.30 a.m.---Vostok 3 launched.

        8.47 a.m.---Japan picks up signals
        from Vostok 3.

        10.08 a.m.---Tass reports that television
        pictures of the spaceman confirm
        he is feeling well. Nikolayev
        sends greetings to the Russian people
        from his spaceship.

        11.19 a.m.---In London a voice is
        heard on the right frequencies saying:
        "Everything normal . . . feeling excellent
        . . . Equipment working well."

        11.30 a.m.---Jodrell Bank reports
        picking up voice faintly.

        12.05 p.m.---Tass reports flight continuing
        normally. All instruments
        and devices on board working accurately.

        # U.S. picks up message

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Saturday.

        The Ohio research centre tracking
        station at Cleveland said this
        afternoon it had recorded a two-minute
        broadcast from Major
        Nikolayev as his spaceship made
        its sixth orbit over the horizon
        north-east of Cleveland at 1.23
        p.m. local time. The voice came
        through loud and clear.

        Part of what the astronaut said
        was: "Soviet Union cosmonaut
        Nikolayev, sitting in Soviet Union
        ship Yostok Three, and am extending
        my regards to the Soviet Union

        WASHINGTON, Saturday.

        The United States has not yet
        received Russia's request to
        refrain from further nuclear tests
        which might endanger Major
        Nikolayev.

        A State Department spokesman
        said tonight: "We wish Major
        Nikolayev a safe flight and happy
        landing. The United States of
        course contemplates no activities
        that would interfere with him in
        any way."

        News of the Russian request
        came at a time when the American
        Space Administration was trying to
        determine what effect the Russian
        test series might have on the
        forthcoming attempt to put Cdr.
        Walter Schirra, 39, into orbit.

        # RADIO TALK NOT CONVINCING

        By a Radio Correspondent

        The news, about the radio-telephone
        conversation between
        Mr. Khruschev and Major Nikolayev
        at 1.7 p.m. G.M.T. was not
        very convincing in spite of the fact
        that Moscow television later
        showed a picture of the major
        "transmitted from the spaceship."

        The peculiar thing about the
        conversation, which was rendered
        from a recording in the Russian
        Home Service on Moscow Radio,
        was that the same kind, or at least
        exceedingly similar, atmospheric
        disturbances seemed to interfere
        with Mr. Khruschev's words as
        well as affecting Major Nikolayev's
        speaking from outer space.

        ## COURAGE

        ## Determination

        Major Titov, the second Russian
        who went into space, said
        after the launching that Major
        Nikolayev is "the embodiment
        of composure, which is necessary
        for the commander of a
        spaceship."

        He added: "My friend is a
        man of iron endurance and
        courageous determination.
        There is no doubt that during
        his flight he will augment
        much that Yuri Gagarin and
        I have done."

        He said Nikolayev "has
        really performed an exploit
        which will go down for ever
        into the heroic annals of the
        conquest of outer space."

        Nikolayev was born in 1929,
        one of six children. His father,
        a collective farmer in a village
        on the middle reaches of the
        Volga, died in 1944.

        At first Nikolayev wanted to
        be a doctor and enrolled in a
        medical school, but later became
        a foreman lumberjack.

        He was called up as a radio
        operator and machine-gunner in
        an army air squadron, and then
        sent to a flying school for
        pilot training.

        ## LUMBERJACK

        ## And Gunner

        After he joined the other cosmonauts,
        he became Titov's reserve
        for the second manned
        space flight.

        When he first visited an airfield
        when he was seven years
        old, Tass said, Nikolayev went
        back to his village and talked
        of nothing but planes.

        He climbed a tree and said
        he would fly from it---had
        to be persuaded to come down.

        IN BRITAIN Jodrell Bank
        picked up the voice of the Russian
        spaceman on the second
        orbit.

        The voice could be heard for
        only a few minutes.

        Sir Bernard Lovell, director
        at Jodrell Bank, commenting
        on the latest Russian rocket,
        said: "If, as seems likely, the
        flight should last several days,
        then this would represent a
        rapid stride in the Russian
        attempt to get a man on the
        moon."

        Moscow, August 12

        Russia today sent its second astronaut into space in 24 hours.
        They were in such close proximity that the first astronaut saw the
        latest Vostok capsule through his porthole.

        An unofficial but usually reliable Soviet source said tonight that
        five space shots would be carried out. Officials, however, declined
        to confirm the figure. Another launching, however, is likely
        tomorrow.

        Major Andrian Nikolayev, aged 32, was joined in space by
        Lieutenant-Colonel Pavel Romanovich Popovich, also aged 32. Major
        Nikolayev today earned the distinction
        of being the world's most
        travelled spaceman. He had made
        more than 24 orbits by 8 p.m. He
        had then travelled about 602,700
        miles, compared with the 437,000
        miles set by Major Titov last
        August.

        Vostok 4, Colonel Popovich's craft,
        had at 8 p.m. orbited eight times and
        covered a total of 186,400 miles.

        The two men are orbiting the earth
        at about 18,000 miles an hour carrying
        out what Tass, the Soviet news agency,
        describes as "joint group work." For
        the first time the astronauts communicated
        with each other in space. Western
        observers meanwhile believe the two
        launchings, and subsequent launchings
        if they occur, are part of a programme
        to assemble a platform for
        an attempt on the moon. They also
        believe that the end of the Vostok
        programme is in sight and that subsequent
        projects will bear a new code
        name.

        Major Nikolayev and Colonel
        Popovich were in communication soon
        after Vostok 4 went into orbit at
        11 2 a.m. (08 02 GMT). They congratulated
        each other on the successful
        "first group flight" of spaceships and
        Major Nikolayev said: "Everything
        is going excellently. I can hear you
        excellently. I feel fine." Colonel
        Popovich said: "I am observing the
        earth through the clouds. On the
        right through the porthole I can see
        the black, black sky. I feel wonderful,
        everything is going excellently.
        Here's to our meeting on earth."
        From earth, Russia's first astronaut,
        Major Yuri Gagarin, joined in the
        conversation and told his successors:
        "Everything's very good, friends. I
        congratulate you. Here's to our meeting
        on earth."

        Vostok 4 is in orbit at an angle of
        65 degrees to the equator and Vostok
        3 is at an angle of 64 degrees, 59
        minutes. Vostok 4 is orbiting the
        earth every 88.5 minutes and its
        nearest point to the earth is about
        111 miles and its farthest 158 miles.
        Vostok 3 is orbiting the earth every
        88.3 minutes at a height between 111
        and 145 miles.

        IT is almost certain that the
        two Russian cosmonauts
        now in orbit are trying to get
        closer to each other. What
        the Americans hope to do in
        Project Rendezvous the
        Russians may be trying to do
        now.

        Meeting in space has many
        implications. It means not only
        that a rocket can be prepared more
        suitably for a journey to the Moon,
        but that satellites can destroy other
        satellites.

        If they perfect the technique,
        the Russians could shoot down
        America's military satellites, such
        as the spy-in-the-sky Midas series.

        The peaceful implications of
        being able to move about in an
        orbit will be demonstrated when
        someone goes to the Moon. The
        spaceship will probably be refuelled
        in orbit before it starts off on its
        longer voyage. The rendezvous
        technique is important.

        ## "SICKNESS" CHECK

        ## Meteor activity

        This twin flight will provide information
        on the so-called "space
        sickness" experienced by Major
        Titov who felt progressively worse
        as his 17-orbit flight last year progressed.

        The Americans must be taking
        note of the fact that both rockets
        were fired just when the Russians
        wanted. If not, the two space craft
        would not be so close.

        So far the Americans have had
        a series of "holds" for each rocket
        firing. Not one with a man aboard
        has taken place at the originally
        appointed time.

        The period from August 8 to 14
        is a time for peak meteor shower
        activity. At one time it was
        thought that these meteor showers
        might prove a hazard to travellers
        in space. It can therefore be presumed
        that the Russians have discovered
        otherwise.

        ## LINK-UP LIKELY

        ## Military significance

        Sir Bernard Lovell said at Jodrell
        Bank yesterday that it was quite
        possible the Russians would
        attempt a rendezvous. This had a
        great military significance as well as
        a significance for peaceful exploration.

        Major Nikolayev now holds the
        record for the longest time in space.
        He will have completed over 30
        orbits and travelled 750,000 miles
        by this morning.

        # MEN IN SPACE

        From "man in space" we have passed
        to "men in space". To have placed
        two satellites in related orbits, each with
        space cabin and human occupant, and
        close enough to have a sight of each
        other, is a remarkable achievement. At
        the least, it argues supreme confidence
        in methods of launching and control.
        It is more, however, than something new,
        done for its own sake. It is at the same
        time an imaginative experiment on
        human reactions to weightlessness and
        a pointer to a new stage in the exploration
        of space. As an experiment on
        weightlessness it is a sequel to the sickness
        felt by MAJOR TITOV, whose record
        of seventeen circuits of the earth has
        already been bettered. This was a new
        effect; it was not experienced by MAJOR
        GAGARIN, who made a single circuit---nor
        was it, later, by the Americans,
        LIEUTENANT-COLONEL GLENN and
        LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER CARPENTER,
        who made three circuits each. Each
        man had been selected, tested, and
        trained. The difference in experience
        could not be attributed to the greater
        length of MAJOR TITOV's flight, for he
        had had the same feeling throughout.
        Was it, then, the result of some idiosyncrasy---physiological
        or psychological---that
        neither tests nor training had
        brought to notice? The question was
        clearly important for the Russians---and
        indeed the Americans. One way to
        obtain an answer would be to carry out
        more tests on TITOV: this the Russians
        must have done. Another is to place
        two or more men in orbit at the same
        time in conditions as nearly identical
        as possible---and compare their
        reactions. This, too, they have done---though
        it may not be the sole, or even
        the main, motive of the launchings.

        To provide means for them to talk to
        each other in flight may be taken as
        part of the experiment. One would like
        to think that they were able at times to
        talk privately---on a wavelength and at
        a power not amenable to eavesdropping
        from ground level. If this is so, we
        have not been told. Their public conversation
        has, on the contrary, introduced
        a new element into the art of
        publicity while in orbit. Here the
        Americans had stolen a march on the
        Russians. They had made the world
        their witnesses---of doubts and alarms,
        not only of success. The Russians have
        been quick this time with television
        pictures; the spectacle of MAJOR
        NIKOLAYEV, attempting to thread a
        needle while weightless, could not have
        been better calculated to impress.

        The placing of two men as neighbours
        in orbit is a landmark in another,
        more important, respect. Many of the
        more grandiose projects in space
        research depend critically on ability to
        arrange a rendezvous above the earth
        between vehicles launched independently
        of each other from the ground.
        Only in this way can it be hoped to
        establish space observatories of more
        than rudimentary performance. Only in
        this way, using present fuels, can a return
        flight from a planet begin to be
        envisaged. There may also be military
        implications, as SIR BERNARD LOVELL
        has suggested; but this, unfortunately,
        may be said of many new achievements---not
        least in space research, where the
        Russians have given ample proof of
        interest.

        If the purpose is, in the long run, to
        effect a rendezvous between space
        vehicles, a test in closely neighbouring
        orbits is, at least, a beginning. Since
        the Russians are nothing if not
        systematic, a double launching---with or
        without men---may well have been a
        step in their long-term programme. With
        men in the space vehicles, it would, in
        addition, be a sensible precaution to
        provide means of adjusting their orbits
        while in flight. Less finesse would be
        necessary for this purpose than to bring
        two vehicles slowly and undamaged into
        contact, but it would still be a start.
        Whether fine control of orbit has been
        provided on the present occasion has not
        been stated. If it has been, and is, used,
        we may expect, in the usual fashion of
        the Russians, that we shall be told of
        it only when done.

        # Tracking team's accuracy

        Johannesburg, August 13

        American and South African tracking
        teams stationed near here claim to have
        calculated the orbits of the Russian
        spaceships so accurately that they can
        say where they took off and where they
        will land.

        Mr Robert Citron, chief of the
        Smithsonian Tracking Station, said both
        the spaceships took off from Kosmondor
        in the Baikonur area (47 deg. N, 65
        deg. E) and would land near Krasneykoot
        in the Saratov area (50 deg. N, 47
        deg E). Mr Citron said that if they
        landed today it would be between 0930
        and 0940 GMT, and if they landed
        tomorrow it would be between 0904 and
        0914 GMT.

        MOSCOW, Tuesday.

        RUSSIA'S "heavenly
        twins," as the Russian
        Press now calls the two cosmonauts,
        are still circling the
        earth to-night after two and
        a half days side by side in
        space. But there are signs
        they are planning to return
        to earth soon.

        Major Nikolayev, code-named
        Falcon, and Lt.-Col. Popovich,
        code-named Golden Eagle, sang
        each other to sleep 150 miles above
        the earth. They sang verses from
        the cosmonauts' song, "I believe,
        my friends."

        It is Major Nikolayev's fourth
        successive night in space. He has
        covered well over a million miles.
        During the night Lt.-Col. Popovich
        will also log a million miles.

        This afternoon they sent a joint
        radio message to the Russian people
        saying that "the outline of the programme
        will be fully completed."
        Major Nikolayev reported later:
        "I am feeling fine."

        ## MOON "REHEARSAL"

        ## Five-day journey

        It is possible that the two spacemen
        will stay up for the five days
        equivalent to the time needed for a
        journey to the moon. Articles in
        the Press all this week have made it
        clear that these flights are a prelude
        to an attack on the moon.

        The message also said that the
        two space capsules are still "close
        together." Late this afternoon Moscow
        television showed two live
        broadcasts from space, showing the
        two fliers inside their capsules.

        Lt.-Col. Popovich, who appears
        to be flying behind Maj. Nikolayev,
        was picked up on the television
        screen only a minute after the
        image of Major Nikolayev faded.

        There is so far no sign of any
        attempt by the two cosmonauts to
        link their ships together or to
        transfer from one ship to the other
        in space. Their conversations have
        emphasised that they hope to meet
        when back on earth.

        The television programmes have
        been impressive. They have
        brought the realities of the flights
        closer to the Russian people than
        any number of official communiqués.

        Each ship has two television
        transmitters, one showing the pilot
        close up from in front, the other
        slightly further away in profile. The
        pilots can be seen making entries
        in their log books and eating
        sandwiches. Lt.-Col. Popovich
        said that after breakfast to-day he
        studied English for an hour.

        This morning a Russian space
        expert, Academician Yevgeny
        Fedorov, condemned the American
        space programme and sneered at
        Telstar. He said: "They test
        systems that fail to work or explode
        at the launching sites." This
        he called "hurried adventurism."

        The Soviet people, he said,
        honoured Lt.-Col. Glenn and Lt.-Cdr.
        Carpenter, the American
        spacemen, but were surprised at
        the casual way in which their lives
        were risked.

        # CAPSULES ARE FAR APART

        ## SHORTER ORBITS

        By Our Science Correspondent

        The two Russian spacemen are
        almost 1,600 miles apart, according
        to calculations made at Jodrell
        Bank late last night. They have
        been picking up the radio signals
        from Major Nikolayev and Col.
        Popovich.

        Sir Bernard Lovell, director of
        the station, said yesterday he
        thought the two spacecraft were
        moving in their own orbits without
        the pilots doing any manoeuvring.
        If they are still up by this morning,
        they will have logged nearly 3 million
        miles between them.

        A report from Sweden yesterday
        stated that both orbit times were
        now less than 88 minutes. The Defence
        Research Institute said it was
        difficult to believe the two men
        would stay up in space much longer
        with such low orbit times.

        Both flights already eclipse all
        previous flights by a very wide
        margin. The next American to go
        into orbit is intended to stay up for
        only six orbits, the number that
        both the Russians achieve in every
        nine-hour period that they stay up.

        # SPACESHIPS IN LOWER ORBIT

        The Russian spaceships are
        steadily approaching the denser
        layers of the atmosphere. Moscow
        Radio reported that by 7 p.m. yesterday
        Vostok III had lost 23.12
        miles in height at its orbit's highest
        point and 8.12 miles at its lowest
        since launching.

        Its apogee was last night 133.75
        miles (156.82 miles at the start)
        and its perigee 106.25 miles
        (114.37). The apogee of Vostok IV
        is now 140 miles (158.75 at the
        start) and 108.1 miles (112.5).

        Sir Bernard Lovell, who described
        the weekend's events as the "most
        remarkable development man has
        ever seen," said last night that he
        doubted whether there would be an
        attempt to rendezvous on this
        occasion, though the possibility
        could not be excluded. The launching
        of two manned spacecraft on
        successive days was a striking
        demonstration of the depth of
        Russian resources and was "quite
        fantastic."

        It was generally agreed that the
        best possible method of getting
        material into the orbit of the moon
        was by "popping little pieces up" and
        joining them, rather than by trying
        to lift the whole load together. Once
        that technique has been mastered
        there was no limit to the size of
        craft that could be added to day by
        day. Even if no attempt were to be
        made to join Vostoks 3 and 4,
        "the two flights will do a great deal
        to explore communication between
        vehicles in space and navigation in
        preparation for subsequent attempts
        to rendezvous in space."

        Sir Bernard said that a year ago
        he felt that both Russian and American
        space activity was moving towards
        an emphasis on the peaceful exploration
        of the solar system. "I don't
        want to be pessimistic," he said, "but
        you cannot divide the military and
        peaceful significance."

        ## American launchings

        It would be quite wrong at this stage
        to underrate the compensating developments
        in the more sophisticated instrumentation
        of American unmanned
        satellites. There were grounds for
        suspecting that similar manoeuvres to
        those the Russians were now trying
        might have been attempted with
        American satellites this year. There
        had been 12 secret American craft
        launchings in the past twelve months
        and there was no information on what
        they were doing.

        An official at Jodrell Bank said last
        night that although they had heard
        at 10 a.m. that Vostok 4 had been
        launched, their interception of the
        message from it half an hour later
        came as a surprise, as they had been
        tuning in to what they supposed to be
        Vostok 3's frequency. They were
        lucky to have with them two Russian
        postgraduate students, who had arrived
        at Jodrell Bank quite coincidentally on
        Friday. On playing back to one of
        them a recording of the message, they
        were told that Colonel Popovich was
        sending greetings to Mr Khrushchev
        and the Soviet people.

        Since the launching of Vostok 3
        they had been keeping a listening
        watch, without using the radio-telescope,
        and estimated that the
        two craft were in roughly the same
        orbit. There seemed to be about four
        miles between them at perigee and
        apogee.

        # RIDDLE OF WHO DESIGNED RUSSIAN SPACESHIP

        By ANTHONY SMITH,
        Daily Telegraph Science Correspondent

        THE statement on Tuesday by Prof. Keldysh, president of the
        Russian Academy of Sciences, that "my friend, the designer
        of the Vostok space ships," has said space trips would soon
        be commonplace is a typically
        tantalising Russian remark.

        No one in the West knows who
        might be the designer of the
        Vostok spaceships. The Russians
        have discouraged the linking of
        personalities with achievement.
        Each space firing is the result of
        "Soviet enterprise and Soviet
        science."

        But several names have emerged
        as being of importance in the
        Russian space programme, For
        instance, there is S. P. KOROLEV.

        It has been reported that he is
        one of the chief designers of the
        sputnik and Vostok rockets. In
        1934 he wrote a book about
        rockets and their flight into the
        stratosphere. Other big names
        are:

        V. P. GLUSHKO, who was co-author
        of a rocketry book in 1935;

        M. K. TIKHONRAVOV, who built and
        tested a liquid propellant rocket
        in 1934;

        A. G. KOSTIKOV, who developed a
        small military rocket widely used
        on the Russian front in the last
        war;

        Y. A. POBEDONOSTSEV, who looked
        after the German engineers from
        the V2 base at Peenemunde; and

        L. S. DUSHKIN, who built a rocket-engine
        which was tested and
        flown in 1941.

        These men have been interested
        in rockets from the start. Generally
        their names are linked with
        propulsion techniques but no one
        could start as a capsule designer.
        The rockets had to come first.

        It is likely that one of them is
        the man behind the Vostok space
        craft. As soon as it was necessary
        to build a man-carrying craft, one
        of them might have devoted himself
        to the subject.

        The Russian distaste for a personality
        cult, even in rocketry, does
        not extend to the recent past. They
        are always mentioning the early
        Russian heroes in the art.

        # Space manœuvres---key to the moon race

        By PETER FAIRLEY

        The "64,000 dollar question"
        now is whether
        Major Nikolayev and Colonel
        Popovich --- or any third,
        fourth or fifth cosmonaut
        sent up after them --- are
        actually able to link their
        spaceships.

        For the power to manoeuvre
        is the key to winning the
        Moon race. Besides transforming
        a spaceman from a
        puppet into an active pilot,
        it also has tremendous military
        implications.

        Given an engine at his back
        that can be restarted at will, a
        cosmonaut can not only nudge
        his spaceship alongside a second
        Vostok for peaceful purposes but
        can change his orbit to destroy
        enemy satellites, take evasive
        action, or head for any point
        on Earth to drop an H-bomb.

        ## Immense value

        And it is not until spaceships
        can be joined together after a
        rendezvous that a human cargo
        can be sent to the Moon.

        The thing that would give
        the West a clue as to whether
        Russia has now jumped this far
        ahead is the weight of the latest
        Vostoks. But so far Russia is
        keeping mum.

        If they are basically the same
        vehicles as those which sent
        Gagarin and Titov hurtling
        round the world then the Soviet
        Union would appear simply to
        be giving cosmonauts the "feel"
        of space rendezvous without
        giving them the tools to do so.

        Such a blooding would be of
        immense value. Men need to
        know, for instance, how easy it
        is to judge the distance between
        two spaceships in orbit.

        They need to know how the
        shape and colour of a Vostok
        stands out in the surrounding
        blackness.

        They need to test the communications
        link between the
        two pilots, and try out "homing"
        devices which might enable them
        to close on one another.

        But it would not add up to
        the major advance over America
        which many are suggesting.

        It would show that Russia has
        developed an exceptionally
        reliable launching rocket whose
        final stage can guide a payload
        into orbit with a breathtaking
        degree of accuracy. But
        the West suspected that already.

        It would also prove that prolonged
        weightlessness --- that
        weird sensation of floating,
        when your forward momentum
        exactly equals the pull of gravity
        --- is no obstacle to men as a
        breed.

        But what the West really
        wants to know now is whether
        an entirely new spaceship has
        been developed---one which can
        roam freely anywhere its pilot
        pleases, or can be joined with
        other spaceships to form one
        huge vehicle.

        Such a monster craft is the
        vital intermediate step to reaching
        the Moon with sufficient
        spare power to get a crew back.
        It would also act as an ideal
        "garage" in which military
        spacecraft could be serviced and
        refuelled while in orbit near the
        Earth. Or as a permanent
        reconnaissance platform.

        Until Mr. K. discloses the size
        and shape of those bits and
        pieces he has popped up we just
        shall not know for sure.

        ## Live TV pictures

        Television pictures of the astronauts
        are being transmitted live from the
        space capsules to the earth. A smiling
        Major Nikolayev was seen holding a log
        book, on which viewers could make out
        the State emblem.

        Moscow television showed Mr
        Khrushchev talking with Colonel
        Popovich in Vostock 4. The Soviet
        leader said: "I hear you, Comrade
        Popovich, I hear you well. I greet
        you warmly, Pavel Romanovich; I
        congratulate you on your wonderful
        heroic achievement. Once again I greet
        also as we have got used to saying---your
        space brother Comrade
        Nikolayev." Colonel Popovich
        replied: "The flight is going on
        successfully. All the systems of the
        ship are operating faultlessly, communications
        are good."

        Mr Khrushchev answered: "I am
        happy that you are in good cheer,
        that the equipment functions well, that
        your voice is cheerful, that you have
        confidence in your spaceship."

        The men also transmitted a telegram
        to Mr Khrushchev, the party, the
        Government, and the people, saying:
        "In accordance with our assignment
        we begin the external flight at a close
        distance. Reliable communications are
        established between the ships. The
        ships' systems are functioning perfectly."
        Tass said Russian scientists
        hope to find out about ways of
        establishing contact between two ships,
        co-ordinating the actions of the astronauts
        and checking the influence of
        identical flight conditions on astronauts.

        This three-way communication
        between the Russian spacecraft
        Vostok 3 and 4 and their ground
        control station may play a big part
        in solving the communication problems
        of spaceships flying to Mars and
        Venus, Mr Konstantin Palatov, a
        Soviet scientist, said today. He told
        Tass: "The possibility of a radio link
        in outer space between spaceships
        flying between the planets Mars and
        Venus may be solved today."

        During his flight Major Nikolayev
        slept for seven hours last night and
        woke at 5 a.m. He has had ordinary
        food in his regular meals and did
        some exercises before breakfast. A
        former lumberjack, he is unmarried.
        Unconfirmed reports said he might
        stay in space for three days, completing
        about 50 orbits.

        If the two astronauts, who last night
        went to bed, are returned safely
        tomorrow, they will probably spend a
        day under medical examination. Then
        they will probably be flown back to
        Moscow for a triumphal welcome at
        the airport by Mr Khrushchev, a
        victory parade into Moscow, and a
        celebration in Red Square.

        Colonel Popovich is one of five
        children; his wife, Maria, aged 31, is
        a woodcutter's daughter. A Ukrainian,
        the Colonel worked as a shepherd
        during his school holidays. His father
        was wounded after German forces
        invaded the Ukraine in 1941, and the
        11-year-old boy became the "man of
        the house," caring for his family. He
        was the first to arrive in the Soviet
        astronauts' unit and helped other
        trainee spacemen, including Gagarin,
        Titov, and Nikolayev, to settle in.

        ## New technique

        A Tass correspondent reported that
        he was told by the Academy of Sciences
        that complex problems were being
        solved by the astronauts, in particular
        "the unparalleled space piloting of
        two ships in simultaneous flights and
        their interaction on practically the
        same orbit." The most important
        question about man's working capacity
        aboard spaceships could be solved only
        with the astronauts' participation, and
        this task was part of the programme
        of studies in the present flight.

        Major Yuri Gagarin, the first
        astronaut, today set a less than 20-year
        target date for manned flights to other
        planets. Forecasting what space
        exploits could be expected 20 years
        from now, he said he hoped that "long
        before 1981 there will appear on the
        moon the first astronomic observatory
        and the first cosmodrome suited for
        flights to Venus and Mars."---Reuter
        and British United Press.

        THE two Russian spacemen, Major Nikolayev, 32,
        and Lt. Col. Popovich, 31, returned safely to
        earth yesterday. They landed in their craft within
        six minutes of each other in a predetermined area
        south of Karaganda, 340 miles from the Cosmodrome
        at Baikonur, Kazakhstan.

        A first report after medical checks said there
        were no grounds for anxiety about the men's health.
        Major Nikolayev, who went into space last Saturday,
        made 64 orbits; Col. Popovich, who went up on
        Sunday, made 48.

        Soon after landing, the men ate a large water
        melon. Then they telephoned Mr. Khruschev. A
        spectacular welcome in Red Square, Moscow, is
        being planned.

        ## "WE WILL STEER TO THE PLANETS"

        The Russian Government said: "The time is approaching
        when we will steer mighty spaceships to the planets."
        Sir Bernard Lovell, director at Jodrell Bank, described the
        Russians as masters of space in the military sense. The
        landing of a man on the Moon in 1967 or 1968 now seemed
        to be entirely realistic. Congratulations were sent to Russia
        by Mr. Macmillan and President Kennedy.

        While American space officials praised Russia for
        "amazing marksmanship" it became known that 20
        unidentified satellites had been launched in secret by the
        United States Air Force since November. They included
        six Samos "spy" satellites.

        Mr. James Webb, head of the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration, expressed the belief that America
        would land a man on the Moon and return him to earth
        before Russia.

        # RENDEZVOUS IN SPACE NOT ATTEMPTED

        By ANTHONY SMITH,
        Daily Telegraph Science Correspondent

        THE most significant facts
        revealed at the Russian
        space conference are that the
        capsules weighed only a little
        more than the two earlier
        ones, and that the two men
        were once within three miles
        of each other.

        The first fact implies that the
        same rocket was used as for most
        of Russia's recent space spectaculars.
        There is no need to consider
        that some gigantic new weapon
        had been extracted from the
        Russian armoury.

        The three-mile distance indicates
        the accuracy of the shooting. The
        fact that the spaceships were six
        minutes apart at the end indicates
        that Major Nikolayev gradually
        speeded up in relation to his
        successor.

        At an orbit time of 88 minutes
        the average speed is about 17,500
        mph. The six-minute gap indicates
        a distance gap of 1,750 miles.

        ## MUCH UNSAID

        But despite the fact that the
        Press conference lasted for nearly
        four hours the Russians managed
        to refrain from mentioning many
        points.

        It seems that no rendezvous was
        tried, in which case the Russians
        are not so far advanced over the
        Americans in this sphere as many
        had thought.

        They also stated nothing about
        the biological control of their
        spaceship and failed to mention
        any difficulties or setbacks. In fact,
        everything worked "perfectly,"
        and this remark alone makes one
        feel they have not disclosed everything
        about their flights.

        JUST a puff of gas---that
        is all "Pop" or
        "Nick" needs to "drift"
        his ship alongside the
        other and establish the
        first station in space.

        From then on it would
        be only a small step to
        building space "stations"
        that remain permanently in
        orbit.

        Stations that could be
        used to launch missiles as
        easily as for refuelling
        moon rockets.

        Less than two miles
        separated Russia's two
        cosmonauts at their nearest
        point in orbit.

        And, in an 18,000 m.p.h.
        "togetherness," both ships
        were taking an identical
        88.5 minutes on each orbit.

        So linking up appears
        to pose few problems. It
        has yet to be done, but it
        is technically feasible.

        Orbital rendezvous solves
        the problem of having to
        develop bigger and better
        rockets to launch bigger
        and better payloads into
        space---and to the moon.

        America's proposed giant
        Nova rocket with a take-off
        thrust of 12,000,000lb.---even
        larger than the massive
        Saturn moon-launcher---is
        its insurance policy against
        the failure of attempts at
        orbital rendezvous.

        But Russia's block-buster
        rockets, developed from
        the brains of captured
        German missile scientists,
        have done it already---apparently
        at the first
        attempt.

        And rocket sections, each
        carrying its own load of
        fuel and supplies, coupled
        together in orbit, could
        form the moon-shot missile---capable
        of taking off
        from a parking orbit for
        the second-stage, two and
        a half-day voyage to the
        Lunar surface.

        At the rendezvous a
        cosmonaut in a "tailor-made"
        space suit could
        pass from rocket section
        to rocket section.

        Once in space he will
        float. A simple swimming
        motion with his hands and
        legs would probably be
        enough to propel him.

        For longer, more tiring
        journeys---such as assembling
        earth-launched sections
        of a space headquarters---he
        would ride a space-mobile
        pushed along by
        jets of compressed gas.

        MOSCOW, Tuesday.

        THE two Russian cosmonauts were only three miles
        apart at one time during their space flight last week,
        they said in Moscow to-day at a Press conference which
        lasted 3¾ hours. They landed by parachute about 125
        miles apart within six minutes of each other, having left
        their space craft in the last
        stages of their descent.

        But in answer to a question,
        Lt.-Col. Popovich said that there
        had been no plan for linking the
        two ships at any time while they
        were in orbit, nor even for bringing
        them closer together by
        manual control.

        Both Major Nikolayev and Col.
        Popovich were considerably franker
        in their answers than Major
        Gagarin and Major Titov had been
        at their first meeting with Western
        correspondents. While describing
        his landing, Major Nikolayev departed
        from the prepared script he
        had been reading.

        They were sitting, with Major
        Gagarin and Major Titov, behind
        a green baize table in the assembly
        hall of Moscow University. Between
        them sat some of Russia's space
        scientists.

        ## WEIGHED 5 TONS

        ## No room for second man

        Col. Popovich said that their
        space craft weighed five tons each,
        a little bigger than the first two
        space ships. They could get out of
        their seats and walk about, but
        there was no room for a second
        space man.

        Describing his landing, Major
        Nikolayev looked up over the
        heads of his audience and said:
        "The retro-rocket was switched
        on, and my capsule separated from
        the instrument compartment. At
        first the deceleration was small.
        Gradually it increased to 5 or 6 G.

        "Then it got even more intense,
        and the capsule became incandescent.
        At first there was smoke,
        which became a flame, first red,
        then orange and then blue. This
        was the time of maximum pressure.

        "Without my preliminary training
        on the centrifuge I would have
        had a hard time. At intervals I
        heard crackling sounds. At first
        I feared the shield was coming off
        the capsule, but then I realised
        that this was just a normal descent.

        ## "LIKE BUMPY CART"

        ## Pressure eased

        "As the speed decreased it was
        like riding in a cart on a bad,
        bumpy road. The pressure gradually
        came down to 1 or 1½ G, and
        it was easier to endure. After a
        time I separated from the space
        ship and came down by parachute."

        Col. Popovich kept strictly to his
        text, but he spoke vividly without
        stumbling over the Russian words
        as Major Nikolayev had done. He
        said that after eating in space he
        had used a vacuum cleaner to
        clear away the crumbs.

        Col. Popovich said he had been
        able to see Major Nikolayev's ship,
        Vostok 3, during their flight in
        space. He had eaten fish, sausage
        and fried chicken.

        ## NO DATE FOR NEXT

        ## Programme well ahead

        One point on which the space
        men would give nothing away was
        the date of the next space flight.
        But they said that the Russian space
        programme was proceeding much
        faster than had been expected when
        the first sputnik was put into orbit.

        Prof. Keldysh, the president of
        the Academy of Sciences, who was
        on the rostrum with other scientists,
        quoted "my friend the
        designer of the space ships" as
        saying: "The time is not far distant
        when you will be able to go
        into space for the week-end."

        Prof. Keldysh agreed that Russia
        was also working on projects for
        interplanetary flight. But before a
        man was sent to another planet
        there would have to be many previous
        automatic space probes.

        ## U.S. ACCUSED

        ## "Space made 'dirty'"

        He accused the United States of
        making space "dirty" with its
        high-altitude atomic tests. "This
        meant that we could not send up
        spacemen in a higher orbit than
        Gagarin and Titov," he said.

        An American correspondent
        asked whether space ships Vostok
        3 and 4 could carry nuclear
        weapons and photograph military
        objectives. Major Popovich said:
        "Our ships are used, and will be
        used, for peaceful purposes only."

        When a Western correspondent
        asked when they would be allowed
        to see a space launching, Prof.
        Keldysh replied: "We'll use these
        rockets for peaceful purposes.

        "But while people call for war
        we must guard our most powerful
        missiles. If Western governments
        sign a treaty of general disarmament
        Western correspondents will
        be able to see a launching."

        ## KENNEDY STATEMENT

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Wednesday.

        President Kennedy said to-day
        the United States was well behind
        Russia in space exploration. "But
        I believe that by the end of the
        decade the United States will be
        ahead."

        The President was asked at his
        Press conference how he sized up
        America's space programme in the
        light of the Russian "Space
        Twin's" feat. He said America
        was well behind Russia. Anyone
        who said otherwise was misleading
        the American people, but America
        would lead before 1970.

      text: "The lesson of Vostoks 3 and 4 is reliability and precision---reliability\nof launch vehicles and precision of guidance into orbit.\n\nWhether or not an attempt is made to connect the two craft\nwhile in orbit---and the wording of the official announcement\nimplied that this was not a primary\naim---the routine way in which two\nmanned space craft have been\nlaunched into similar, prolonged\norbits around the earth within 24\nhours surpasses any previous\nachievement in the field of earth\norbital flight.\n\nThe series of seven unmanned\nCosmos satellites which were launched\nbetween March 16 and July 28 this\nyear did not appear to mark a major\nadvance, although as their weight was\nnot disclosed and few details of the\ncraft were given, it was impossible to\nknow just how advanced they were.\nBut one of their stated purposes was\nto study \"the energy composition of\nthe earth's radiation belts with the\naim of evaluating the radiation danger\nof long cosmic flights.\"\n\n## A starting point\n\nSpeculation on the type of \"long\ncosmic flight\" envisaged certainly\nincluded extended earth orbital flights\nby two men---but it was assumed that\nthe two cosmonauts would share the\nsame spacecraft. Once again, Soviet\nspace technology has pulled a spectacular\nrabbit out of the hat, in the\ntrue tradition of the series of impressive\nachievements from Sputnik I in\nOctober, 1957, to Major Titov's day in\norbit just one year ago.\n\nThe technique of connecting together\ntwo or more spacecraft sections while\nin orbit around the earth is bound\nto become one of the routine tricks\nof space flight within the next few\nyears, and may well be used as a\nstarting point for manned trips to the\nmoon. To get to the moon and back \nusing only one launch vehicle would\nrequire a gigantic rocket; in spite of\nwhich, the payload carried would be\nsmall. Smaller rockets and larger payloads\nare made possible by the\nrendezvous technique.\n\nIf the Russians are in fact planning\nto use this technique for manned flight\nto the moon, this will be in marked\ncontrast to the way the United States\nis planning to get there. The US\nNational Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration spent 12 months studying\nthe problem and only last month\nannounced its decision not to employ\nearth orbital rendezvous in its project\nApollo programme of manned lunar\nexploration.\n\nThe American intention is to place\na three-man spacecraft in orbit around\nthe moon in one direct shot from\nearth using an advanced Saturn booster.\nWhile in orbit around the moon a small\ntwo-man \"lunar excursion module\"\nwill detach itself from the main body\nof the craft and will descend to the\nlunar surface.\n\nAfter the two astronauts have completed\ntheir work on the moon, their\nexcursion vehicle will take off, leaving\nits tripod legs behind it, and connect\nup again with the parent spacecraft,\nwhich will still be circling the moon.\nThe astronauts will transfer to the\nmain craft, the excursion vehicle will\nbe jettisoned, and the return journey\nto earth will begin. In effect, lunar\norbital rendezvous has been substituted\nfor earth orbital rendezvous in the US\nplan.\n\nIn announcing this hazardous-sounding\noperation last month, the National\nAeronautic and Space Administration\nsaid that this method was believed to\nprovide a higher probability of success\nwith \"essentially equal\" safety. Also,\nit promised success \"some months\nearlier\" than other methods, and\nwould be 10 to 15 per cent cheaper.\n\nSoviet thinking may well be running\nalong similar lines, for experiments in\nearth orbital rendezvous will be necessary\nwhichever technique is finally\nemployed for the lunar flight. The\nsame methods of orbit adjustment and\nspacecraft control for rendezvous will\nbe needed whether the body beneath\nhappens to be the earth or the moon.\n\nThe US Gemini programme of earth\norbital flight by two-man versions of\nthe existing Mercury craft, due to\nbegin next year, will include exercises\nin orbital rendezvous. In this programme,\nhowever, the initial tests will\ninvolve a manned Gemini craft connecting\nin orbit with an unmanned\npiece of metal---an Agena upper-stage\nrocket body.\n\n## US experiment\n\nAlthough little has been said about\nit, the Americans have already tried to\nachieve earth orbital rendezvous of a\nkind. This attempt, part of a military\n\"satellite inspector\" programme\nknown by the code name Saint, was\nmade in April. An Atlas-Agena and a\nBlue Scout were launched from different\nbases at different times with\nthe object of a rendezvous in orbit\nbetween their two payloads, but the\nexperiment was unsuccessful following\nthe second-stage failure of one of the\nrockets.\n\nThe agonising postponements, from\nday to day and week to week, of many\nlaunchings of American spacecraft\nfrom Cape Canaveral underlines the\nimmense achievement of the Soviet\nUnion over the weekend. Two men in\norbit, circling the earth in separate\nvehicles and talking to each other---space\nis beginning to become crowded.\n\nThe fact that the orbits into which\nVostoks 3 and 4 were placed are almost\nidentical indicates a standard of\naccuracy which has never before been\nachieved, even by the Russians. The\nUS Discoverer satellite programme,\nbegun in 1959 and still continuing, has\nnot approached this standard, even\nwith a time between identical launchings\nof weeks rather than one day.\nNeither has the Soviet Cosmos series\nwhich preceded Vostoks 3 and 4.\n\nThe best and most recent US\nexample of orbital precision occurred\non August 5, when a secret Air Force\nlaunching of Atlas-Agena from Point\nArguello, California, achieved for the\nfirst time by any country, an almost\nexactly circular orbit.\n\nThe US lunar exploration programme,\nApollo, is already being\ntackled at what many observers believe\nto be too fast a pace, because of the\nprestige importance which President\nKennedy attaches to it. The effect of\nthis weekend's launchings, and their\nimplications for the future, will clearly\nbe to increase the pressure still further.\n"

        MR. KHRUSCHEV said
        yesterday in his Red
        Square welcome to the spacemen
        that there is no mystery
        about their flights. This is not
        strictly true.

        On this occasion there are no
        doubts that the flights actually
        took place. But the Russians have
        not been wildly forthcoming over
        the facts about the flights.

        Was a rendezvous intended?
        Did the men manipulate their craft
        towards each other? How far
        apart were they when they saw
        each other? Was there anything
        that did not go as planned?

        These are all crucial questions.
        Subsidiary questions concern the
        size, weight and furnishings of the
        space ships. How was the biological
        environment controlled? Did
        weightlessness for such a long
        period have no ill effects at all?

        In his speech yesterday Mr.
        Khruschev reasserted that the
        spacemen had been able to see
        each other. Now, even large ships
        become small in the enormity of
        space. And you would have to be
        fairly close to a bus to see it.

        ## 10 Years ahead

        Despite the meagre facts given
        to us, Sir Bernard Lovell, director
        of the radio astronomy station at
        Jodrell Bank, has summed up the
        situation. He says the Russians are
        10 years ahead of the Americans.

        Many Americans will not go so
        far. Ex-President Eisenhower
        said last week he thought
        the Americans were still on top.

        Yet there is one fact that has
        been blatantly true ever since
        Sputnik I was fired into orbit
        nearly five years ago. This is that
        the sort of rockets the Russian
        space scientists have been able to
        call upon from the military
        armoury have been colossal.

        ## Pictures not revealing

        They were big even at the start
        of the race. Russia has never sent
        up anything weighing less than
        180lb. and practically everything
        sent up has been over one ton.
        The Americans have fired objects
        even as small as 3½lb. into orbit.
        Their Mercury capsule soon to be
        launched for six orbits weighs just
        on one ton.

        The capsule for the two latest
        Russians weighed at least four
        tons, and was probably nearer
        eight. But, unlike the Americans,
        who sent their first capsule on a
        world tour, the Russians have said
        nothing about their latest space
        dwellings. Pictures of them taken
        from inside were not very
        revealing.

        With such big launchers available
        every Russian achievement is more
        sensational for reasons of size
        alone. But their precision and guidance
        is good, too, for both the
        rockets last week-end were fired
        just at the right time into nearly
        identical orbits.

        MOSCOW, Saturday.

        ANOTHER Russian sputnik in space . . .
        and a fantastic welcome for the "heavenly
        twins" Nikolayev and Popovich.

        IN SPACE is Cosmos 8. It was launched to-day
        and carries "scientific apparatus for the continuation
        of research of space." There was no mention of a
        man aboard.

        ON EARTH hugs, kisses and a sea of flowers as
        four-and-a-half million people headed by Mr.
        Kruschev gave a spectacular and fantastic welcome
        to marathon spacemen Lieutenant-Colonel Popovich
        and Major Nikolayev.

        It was Soviet pageantry at its
        most spectacular---and human
        drama at its most intimate.

        And it was a moment shared
        by millions in Britain as they
        watched the proceedings on
        their television screens.

        But I was there at Moscow's
        Vnukovo Airport and joined
        the cheering.

        Nikolayev and Popovich
        boarded an Ilyushin 18 airliner
        at Voldagrad, 700 miles south-east
        of the city, on their way to
        receive a heroes' welcome.

        ## CRUSHED

        ## Against Barrier

        With thousands of Russians---pressed
        tight against crush
        barriers set up outside the airport
        building---I watched as
        the giant airliner dropped out
        of a brilliantly sunny sky and
        screamed along the runway.

        As the plane taxied towards
        the waiting crowd the cheers
        were deafening.

        Mr Kruschev, his face beaming
        with smiles, waited impatiently
        for the twin cosmonauts
        to step from the plane.

        It was on the stroke of noon
        that the door of the airliner
        swung open to give Moscow its
        first glimpse of the pair who
        had made space history.

        ## A HALT

        ## The Salutes

        In perfect step they marched
        together to the flower-decked
        dais where Mr. Kruschev,
        Soviet leaders and members of
        their families were waiting to
        greet them.

        As they reached the top of
        the steps, to face the Soviet
        leader they came to a halt and
        simultaneously threw up smart
        salutes.

        Then came the report---by
        now almost a tradition with
        Soviet cosmonauts---to Mr.
        Kruschev, the Communist Party
        and the Government: "Mission
        accomplished successfully. We
        are ready to carry out any further
        tasks."

        Suddenly formality was
        thrown to the winds. First
        one and then the other was
        embraced and kissed by
        Kruschev.

        Lt.-Col. Popovich swung his
        six-year-old daughter Natasha
        high in his arms and hugged
        his wife Maria.

        The cosmonauts' mothers,
        wearing shawls, and the rest
        of their families stood on the
        reception platform. Lieutenant-Colonel
        Popovich hugged his
        mother Feodosia.

        # "GOD" JOKES BY COSMONAUTS

        ## TV PROGRAMME

        MOSCOW, Thursday.

        The Russian cosmonauts Col.
        Gagarin, Major Titov and Col.
        Popovich joked about seeing God
        before televiewers in Moscow tonight.
        In a programme devoted to
        their flights in space they replied
        to a woman of 70 who wrote asking
        if they had seen God.

        Col. Popovich said, amid laughter:
        "I saw God. I asked him his
        name. He replied, 'Andrian Nikolayev.'"
        This was his "twin"
        cosmonaut. "I am joking, of
        course. I really didn't see any God
        up there."

        Col. Gagarin said: "The real
        God, the true God, has very little
        speed because he travels on only
        three horses." Major Titov
        quoted the poet, Mayakovsky:
        "The sky was examined from
        inside and from outside, and no
        gods were found.'"---Reuter.

        At least three Soviet cosmonauts are going to
        be sent together to land on the moon
        according to Lieut.-Colonel Yuri Gagarin in a
        statement released through the Soviet News
        Service in London today.

        Forecasting the way
        Russia will assault the
        moon the pioneer spaceman---now
        commander of
        Russia's Cosmonaut
        Squadron---says that after
        robot sputniks have
        explored the lunar face big
        transport rockets will
        dump stocks of food, fuel
        and tools there.

        Pre-fabricated parts from
        which huts can be built---made
        of lightweight foam
        metal---are also likely to be
        sent ahead of men.

        "Only a well-prepared
        team will be able to fulfil
        the task of making the initial
        study of this 'difficult' planet
        which is heated to 120 degrees
        Centigrade in daytime and
        cooled to minus 150 degrees
        at night," adds Gagarin.

        "Men will need, of course,
        special insulated clothing to
        be able to appear on the
        surface."

        ## Maths in orbit

        Fresh detail about Russia's
        double space flight, also released
        today, reveals that Major
        Nikolayev spent nearly a week
        inside a Vostok space ship on
        the ground before he was passed
        fit for the 1,500,000 mile trip.
        Doctors watched him throughout
        for signs of a mental breakdown.

        To test the effects of weightlessness
        the cosmonauts had to
        do complicated mathematics,
        recognise geometrical figures,
        tot up horizontal and vertical
        columns of numbers and enter
        their answers in a log book while
        they orbited the world.

        Comment from their doctors
        today on the spacemen's
        appetites: "The only thing that
        makes them eat during a three
        or four day flight is---nervousness."

        # Fuel stations in space

        ONE of Russia's space
        scientists, Prof. KONSTANTIN
        EGOROV, said to the
        Physics Section that the cosmonauts
        Nikolayev and
        Popovich could have stayed
        up "several times as long"
        as their three and four-day
        journeys. There were sufficient
        stores to maintain conditions
        inside the five-ton spaceships.

        He also disclosed that radio
        contact with the automatic instruments
        of the spaceships had been
        maintained during the re-entry into
        the earth's atmosphere, when
        ionisation due to the great heating
        destroyed radio communications
        with the American spaceships.

        "If we could be sure the takeoff
        from the moon to the earth
        would be quite as successful as
        the spaceships' trips, then the
        possibility of mastering the moon
        is very good," he said.

        Prof. Egorov said the flights had
        shown "great possibilities for
        organising interplanetary stations
        on a large scale, which will serve
        for refuelling cosmic ships and so
        on. I think these cosmic flights
        are one more stage in making man
        master of cosmic space in flights
        round the earth and the other
        planets."

        ## ROCKET MOTORS

        Another of the 20 Russians at the
        meeting, Prof. S. M. VINOROV, of
        the Moscow Aviation Institute, has
        been engaged in producing
        specially hard materials for rocket
        motors. He is to lecture to-day to
        the engineering section.

        He said yesterday that the problem
        of the heat of rocket motors
        was being tackled by special alloys,
        such as titanium, and ceramics. His
        leature will be on "super-strong"
        forms of pure metals, obtained by
        producing metals with uniform
        crystalline structures.

        # Deletion of Periscopes On Spacecraft Studied

        BOULDER, Colo. (UPI)---Project
        Mercury officials are thinking
        about eliminating the periscope on
        space capsules to permit them to
        carry more fuel, Lt Col John
        Powers said here.

        Powers, Project Mercury information
        officer, made the statement
        at an impromptu news conference
        on the porch of the home of University
        of Colorado President Quigg
        Newton, where astronaut Scott
        Carpenter and his party ate dinner.

        ## Double Trouble

        Both Carpenter last Thursday,
        and his predecessor in orbital
        flight, John H. Glenn Jr., in February,
        were bothered by rapid depletion
        of the hydrogen peroxide
        which the astronaut squirts from
        jets outside the capsule to stabilize
        it or change its position in space.

        Powers noted that only so much
        payload can be lifted into orbit.
        If the fuel is increased, he said,
        something else might have to be
        left off.

        ## Stage Fright

        "We're not too sure the periscope
        is that important," he said.

        Powers also revealed that Carpenter
        approached his post-orbit
        news conference with some trepidation
        despite the fact that newsmen
        afterward hailed him as a "whale
        of a reporter."

        Powers also said Alan B. Shepard
        Jr., who made the first manned
        American rocket flight last year,
        also had this "stage-fright" problem.
        Powers said Shepard once
        said, "I slept better the night before
        the flight than I did the night
        before the press conference."

        Powers said Carpenter made two
        substantial scientific contributions
        in his orbital flight. One, he said,
        was the "fantastic pictures" Carpenter
        took. The other was the
        proof that long periods of weightlessness
        were not a problem.

        # ARIEL WORKING "OFF AND ON"

        ## SUNLIGHT NEEDED

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Wednesday.

        Ariel, the Anglo-American
        satellite, is working only intermittently
        as a result of the damage
        to it by last month's American
        high-altitude nuclear test, space
        scientists reported to-day. It goes
        dead for days at a stretch.

        Only when exposed to long
        periods of sunshine does it come
        back to life. Scientists had analysed
        Ariel's signals in the six weeks
        since the bomb created an intense
        but temporary radiation belt round
        the earth on July 9.

        Ariel is not working at present.
        Its signal went off again last Monday.

        # Astronauts Confirm Freud Theory

        PHILADELPHIA (AP)---The
        Project Mercury psychiatrist said
        many of Sigmund Freud's theories
        about the human mind have been
        confirmed by the flights of astronaut
        Malcolm Scott Carpenter and
        his predecessors.

        Dr. George E. Ruff of Philadelphia
        said that America's man-in-space
        program has especially buttressed
        Freud's idea that the external
        dangers a man faces are
        less important to him than his
        own inner drives.

        Ruff said in an interview that
        the perils of blastoff, orbiting and
        reentry won't concern a man if
        what he wants is vital enough to
        him.

        Ruff, assistant professor of psychiatry
        at the University of Pennsylvania
        Medical School, has just
        returned from Cape Canaveral. He
        interviewed Carpenter before and
        after his three-orbit flight around
        the earth last Thursday. He headed
        the team of psychiatrists that originally
        screened the Project Mercury
        astronauts. He also examined
        John H. Glenn Jr., Virgil I.
        (Gus) Grissom and Alan B. Shepard
        Jr. after their flights.

        "Freud said that external environmental
        stresses aren't the
        things that bother people most,"
        Ruff said. "He said that internal
        ones were more important.

        "The way the astronauts have
        responded is confirmation of what
        Freud said. It's amazing how their
        own internal personalities have responded.

        "For example, in each case, what
        they think of things around them
        is more important than, say, the
        temperature of reentry.

        ## Fear of Failure

        "And, Freud said that was usually
        true of most people---that the
        fear of failure is more important
        than the fear of dangers.

        "In everday life, that would mean
        you don't become neurotic because
        of the stress of overwork but because
        of some internal stress."

        Ruff's main research interest is
        stress and its effects on man.

        He said the flights also have
        shown that a person is able to
        handle a great deal of emotional
        stress. "We suspected that, of
        course, but you don't know for
        sure until you try."

        # SATELLITE PACT ANNOUNCED

        ## AMERICA AND RUSSIA

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Wednesday.

        America and Russia announced
        an agreement in the United Nations
        to-day to co-operate in the use of
        artificial earth satellites. Mr. Adlai
        Stevenson, chief American delegate,
        and Mr. Zorin, chief Russian
        delegate, handed the joint letter to
        U Thant, the Secretary-General

        Co-operation involves communication,
        weather forecasting and
        mapping the world's magnetic field.
        Mr. Stevenson said it was "a practical
        demonstration that our two
        nations can, despite political differences,
        co-operate in a highly
        important field of human
        endeavour."

        A Russian spokesman said his

        # SPACE STUDY URGED TO KEEP SCIENTISTS

        DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTER

        SPACE research by the
        Atomic Energy Authority
        is suggested as one way to
        prevent the break-up of
        skilled scientific staffs who are
        becoming redundant because
        of reduced defence needs.

        The proposal is made by the
        Institution of Professional Civil
        Servants. It says compensation
        offered is a "miserly, tin-plated
        handshake scheme which evades
        the nation's obligations to those
        scientists who helped to make
        Britain a nuclear power."

        Mr. T. H. Profitt, deputy general
        secretary of the Institution, said
        yesterday that talks on the future
        of these scientists were being
        sought with Viscount Hailsham,
        Minister of Science.

        "Our contention is that the
        Authority should be allowed to be
        adaptable, either to non-military
        fields such as space research or to
        other civil programmes."

        ## TREASURY BLAMED

        The Institution blames the
        Treasury, not the Authority, for
        the "miserable" and shocking
        compensation plan. About 200 of
        the scientific staff and 2,000
        workers are expected to become
        redundant.

        Non-industrial staff, including
        scientific, technical and professional
        workers, with less than three
        years' service will get no compensation.

        Those with three years and
        more will get two-thirds of a
        week's pay for each year of service,
        but if pension rights are
        preserved only one-third of a
        week's pay for each year.

        Mr. Profitt said: "The fact that
        the whole of the Authority's staff
        has played an indispensable part
        in providing Britain with a nuclear
        deterrent is of no account to the
        Treasury." It was merely concerned
        to see that compensation
        should be no more than nominal.

        He pointed out that terms for
        the Armed forces in 1957 were
        on a much bigger scale. In
        Euratom, which the Government
        was negotiating to join, compensation
        could amount to 60 per cent.
        of basic salary from the date of
        redundancy up to the age of 60.

        # BRITISH SPACE STUDY IN 1963

        ## Second satellite to be launched

        BY OUR SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT

        BRITAIN'S second satellite
        is expected to be launched
        by the Americans in the
        middle of next year. It is
        still without a name and is
        being referred to as S.52.

        In the Royal Society's Council
        Report, published yesterday, it is
        also stated that the engineering
        prototypes of the satellite's equipment
        are almost ready for delivery
        to the United States.

        These prototypes will be tested
        by the Americans in various ways,
        such as by intensive vibration and
        temperature changes. When they
        have been examined thoroughly,
        the actual instruments to be
        launched will follow them across
        the Atlantic.

        ## ARIEL'S SUCCESSOR

        S.52 is following in the path of
        Ariel, Britain's first satellite, known
        originally as S.51. Ariel was
        launched by the Americans in
        April, 1962.

        The information it collected is
        still being examined by the computers
        of the United States
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration and the United
        Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.

        It is possible that a third British
        satellite (S.53) will be launched by
        the Americans. They offered
        originally to launch three, but it
        has taken the British scientists
        quite a time to fill even two satellites
        with well-built and exciting
        experiments. In any case, S.53 is
        unlikely to be launched before
        1964.

        # Army to Get New Missile, Cargo Truck

        WASHINGTON (Special) --- The
        Army has announced the selection
        of the Chance Vought Corp., a division
        of Ling-Temco-Vought Inc., as
        prime contractor for two of its
        newest development programs,
        Missile B and a 1¼-ton cargo
        truck, the XM561.

        The Missile B contract will be
        for development and initial production
        of the missile system and is
        anticipated to be approximately
        $100 million. The XM561 contract
        will be for development of the new
        vehicle and is expected to be approximately
        $2½ million.

        When developed, Missile B will
        provide increased fire support for
        the combat divisions. It will
        complement conventional artillery
        with both nuclear and non-nuclear
        supporting fire on the battlefield.

        Planned as a simple, low-cost,
        rugged and reliable weapon system,
        Missile B will use a new guidance
        concept developed by U.S. Army
        Missile Comd engineers at Redstone
        Arsenal, Ala.

        The XM561 will be a six-wheeled
        vehicle which can "swim" inland
        waters and traverse rough terrain
        with an agility unmatched by
        other wheeled vehicles. The contract
        calls for development and
        construction of several prototypes.

        The basis of the new development
        will be a vehicle called the
        "Gamma Goat," already developed
        by Chance Vought on its own initiative.
        The "Gamma Goat" has
        demonstrated exceptional mobility
        over numerous rugged military
        test courses both in the United
        States and in Europe.

        In soliciting proposals for the
        development of the XM561, the
        Army specified that primary consideration
        would be given to maximum
        mobility and other cross-country
        and off-road capabilities.
        After a thorough analysis of all
        proposals, including those from
        several automotive manufacturers,
        the Army selected the
        Chance Vought design concept as
        offering a substantially higher
        degree of off-road mobility.

        The XM561 will derive its mobility
        from two lightweight units
        working together in combination
        --- a four-wheeled tractor unit and
        a two-wheeled carrier linked together
        to provide power to all six
        wheels and pivoted to permit unusual
        flexibility.

        # Work Laid Out for First Man on the Moon

        GATLINBURG, Tenn. (AP) --- The
        first man on the moon may
        be a geologist, or a civil engineer.

        He will look for living forms on
        the surface or at some distance
        below the hostile lunar surface. Or
        he will search for remains of previous
        life.

        He will poke inquisitively here
        and there, picking up specimens
        for laboratory study, taking pictures,
        drilling holes and implanting
        instruments.

        This was the picture of man on
        the moon, envisioned by Homer E.
        Newell, director of the Office of
        Space Sciences of the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration.

        Newell drew the picture for
        about 300 scientists and technicians
        gathered here to discuss space
        radiation hazards, to stress the
        point that man, in person --- not
        merely machines or satellites ---
        must eventually explore space.

        "No matter how you design and
        build, you won't be able to put
        man's discernment, judgment, versatility
        and adaptability in space
        except by putting the man himself
        there," Newell said.

        For these and other reasons, the
        United States has committed itself
        in efforts to place a man on the
        moon within this decade, he said.

        "At some point in complexity and
        distance from the earth, it will
        actually become cheaper to use the
        man than to build the mechanical
        substitute," Newell said.

        One can foresee the need to assemble
        in space large laboratories,
        huge antenna systems, stations to
        serve as launching areas for interplanetary
        flight, and even space
        vehicles for the flights, Newell
        said.

        He also predicted that engineering
        in space will form an important
        segment of manned operations in
        space for future military purposes.

        Besides finding clues to how the
        moon and planets were formed,
        the astronaut-scientist will seek
        indications of present or past life
        on the moon, the NASA scientist
        said.

        Finding living beings there is
        unlikely, he said.

        "But even if there are no living
        forms on the moon, other biologists
        point out that the moon is
        still of interest in that it may
        carry the residue of previously
        living forms or . . . precursors to
        life."

        Mars, on the other hand, has
        certain characteristics which do
        not prove the existence of life but
        are "most certainly highly provocative,"
        he said.

        THE intense activities in space recently and those to come
        before Parliament reassembles mean pressure will undoubtedly
        be brought to bear on the Government to step up
        Britain's endeavours in this field.

        Britain's present efforts are a minimum, compared with
        those of the two major space Powers. Also, both our main contributions
        are international rather than national in character.
        Our satellites, and only one has been launched so far, are going
        into space by kind permission of
        the United States.

        Britain's rocket programme is
        going to succeed in launching
        anything only if it receives the
        co-operation, and money, of certain
        European countries.

        Yet other European countries
        have plans of their own, apart from
        any co-operative ventures. France,
        Italy and West Germany are all
        working alone on various significant
        space projects.

        ## LOW OUTLAY

        ## Present policy

        The success of the Telstar
        operation was clouded, or so many
        thought, by the realisation that the
        Post Office and our communication
        systems would always have to do
        their work in space by the courtesy
        of the Americans, unless present
        policy is changed.

        Present policy dictates that
        British spending on space be kept
        low. On satellites the budget is
        £400,000 a year; on a European
        launcher under the European
        Launcher Development organisation's
        scheme, Britain is to contribute
        about £6 million a year;
        and on communication experiments
        the Post Office has spent just
        £750,000 in putting up the
        Goonhilly aerial.

        ## "NATIONALIST EYES"

        ## France a competitor

        Mr. Kenneth Gatland, vice-president
        of the British Interplanetary
        Society, and author of a
        new book, "Astronautics in the
        Sixties," contends that British
        technology will suffer if a greater
        part is not played in the space age.

        He said yesterday that British
        policy was being fashioned chiefly
        by scientists, not technologists. If
        Britain does not care more for the
        technological by-products resulting
        from space work, she will slip
        behind in such spheres as automation,
        computers, ceramics,
        metallurgy, and plastics.

        He added that it may be honourable
        and correct to see space
        as something that should be explored
        co-operatively, but other
        countries were looking at it with
        nationalist eyes. France was doing
        so, and she was a powerful competitor.

        ## BIGGER BENEFITS

        ## Other countries' work

        For the European Launcher Development
        Organisation, Britain's
        share of the work was just to do
        with Blue Streak, a rocket based
        on principles 10 years old.

        All the other countries, including
        Italy, France, Germany, Holland
        and Belgium, will be breaking
        new ground. For lesser contributions
        in money they may be
        benefiting more.

        Some day, when communication
        satellites are being fired as
        regularly as communication cables
        are laid now, it will pay the
        launchers to have an equatorial
        launching site.

        The rockets will not have to use
        valuable fuel twisting their flight
        paths so that the satellite arrives
        in an equatorial orbit, the one most
        suitable for communications.

        Woomera is quite unsatisfactory
        from this point of view. Places
        like the Seychelles, the island
        group in the Indian Ocean, would
        be much better.

        ## FLOATING ROCKET SITES

        ## Italian scheme

        The Italians are taking a considerable
        interest in Somalia. Besides
        plans for launching platforms
        at sea, which could fire the Scout-type
        rockets Italy expects to buy
        from the United States, they have
        prospected the land for launching
        sites.

        Space exploration is expensive.
        But so are, for instance, land-based
        communications, and the intra-Commonwealth
        cable now being
        laid will cost £90 million.

        Britain will be using space for
        communications at some time. But
        when or how has not been decided
        officially.

        # LEONARDO SCHEME FOR SPACECRAFT

        ## ESCAPE SYSTEM

        FROM A SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
        VARNA, Bulgaria, Wednesday.

        A DESIGN by Leonardo da
        Vinci is being used as a
        model for the escape system
        in the American two-man
        Gemini space flight due to
        start next year.

        If anything goes wrong after
        re-entry to the atmosphere an
        inflatable plastic paraglider, half
        glider, half parachute, will be
        extended above the capsule. This
        will provide lift for a controlled
        landing.

        The kite-like shape of the extended
        42ft wings is derived from
        Leonardo's sketches for a bat-like
        flying machine. The spacecraft
        makes a gliding descent.

        In another escape system the
        men can be thrown clear in ejector
        seats. A specially designed parachute
        has been developed to bring
        them to earth.

        Astronauts will not go up in the
        Gemini spacecraft until the escape
        systems have been proved. Test
        fights will be made next year.

        ## LONGER FLIGHT SOON

        Dr. S. A. Glazunov, of Russia,
        said at the annual congress of the
        International Astronautical Federation
        at Varna to-day that the astronauts
        Lt.-Col. Popovich and Major
        Nikolayev survived their days of
        weightlessness so well that longer
        manned space flights may be expected
        "very soon."

        But the Russians are still worried
        by possible effects of weightlessness.
        "What we are afraid of is
        that a degree of muscular disintegration
        may develop."

        # INDONESIA GETS RUSSIAN MISSILES

        JAKARTA, Wednesday.

        AN Indonesian Army spokesman
        said in Jakarta last night
        that Indonesia is to establish a
        guided missile flotilla equipped with
        surface-to-surface and surface-to-air
        missiles supplied by Russia.

        He said that the Indonesian Government
        had sent hundreds of
        Navy personnel to Russia for missile
        training over the past 18
        months.

        ALTHOUGH the Ministry
        of Science reaction to the
        damage received by the British
        satellite Ariel remains one of
        "disappointment," some of
        the scientists who designed
        the satellite's experiments are
        not at all displeased.

        It was at first thought that the
        radiation from the American high
        altitude nuclear test on July 9 had
        damaged the solar batteries beyond
        repair, but since Ariel re-started
        its transmissions last Friday,
        reports have become more
        optimistic.

        University scientists with whom
        I spoke yesterday rather welcomed
        the radiation effects. They pointed
        out that they already possess many
        hundreds of hours recordings of
        effects in normal conditions.

        Measurements have been taken
        of electron density, cosmic ray and
        X-ray intensities in quiet solar conditions.

        Creation by the Americans of
        a minor new Van Allen radiation
        belt has enabled them to start
        again. They hope to obtain
        valuable information on how a
        disturbed radiation pattern settles
        down again.

        ## U.S. OBSERVED RULES

        The scientists stressed that they
        did not encourage indiscriminate
        space bombardments, but pointed
        out that the Americans had asked
        their advice before the July 9 test
        and had scrupulously observed conditions
        laid down by the Ariel
        scientists.

        While the extent of the damage
        to Ariel is likely to remain unknown,
        its main effect will be to
        shorten rather than weaken the
        radio transmissions. When the
        signals fall below a certain strength
        they are automatically cut-out to
        conserve the batteries.

        On the legal issue of redress Mr.
        Christopher Shawcross, Q.C.,
        former chairman of the Institute of
        Space Law, told me that international
        law and the United
        Nations regulations could be
        stretched to cover this contingency
        up to a point.

        The procedure would be an
        application to the International
        Court at the Hague to determine
        whether such claims came within
        their jurisdiction. Alternatively,
        the United Nations Assembly
        could ask the International Court
        for an opinion.

        # BRITISH ARIEL SATELLITE NOT DEAD

        By JOHN DELIN
        Sunday Telegraph Science Correspondent

        AS with Mark Twain,
        reports of the British
        satellite Ariel's premature
        death have been grossly exaggerated.
        "Good, if periodic
        readings are still being
        received," a Ministry of
        Science spokesman said to me
        yesterday.

        Ariel was first reported to be
        sending erratic signals on Aug.
        20 after damage caused by the
        United States' July 9 nuclear test.
        On Aug. 30 Dr. A. P. Willmore,
        one of the team at University
        College, London, who designed part
        of the instrumentation, reported
        its "death" to the British Association
        meeting in Manchester.

        Dr. Willmore rather modified his
        attitude when he discussed the
        matter with me in London yesterday.
        "Ariel is dead for the purposes
        of our particular experiment,"
        he said, "although the experiment
        itself was a success. We can expect
        no further considerable data to be
        forthcoming."

        ## "COME BACK" POSSIBLE

        Although Ariel was still transmitting,
        there had been no useful
        information for the past fortnight.
        There was a good chance that the
        satellite would come back into
        operation early in November when
        it would stay in continuous sunlight
        for four or five days, avoiding
        the earth's shadow.

        There were believed to be two
        faults. These were:

        1.---Damage, already reported, to
        the battery-charging system,
        which had reduced, but not
        stopped, the rate of charging;
        and

        2.---Interruption of the links
        between the experiment, the
        encoder and the transmitter
        which sent the coded message.

        It was reasonably possible that
        a continuous period of sunlight
        might raise the satellite's temperature
        sufficiently to enable the
        internal fault to rectify itself.

        In that case the reading which
        would be received would report the
        changed ionisation and radiation
        densities in the lower Van Allen
        belts.

        # MAN ON MOON PROJECT RUNS INTO TROUBLE

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        WASHINGTON, Thursday.

        AMERICAN plans to land a
        man on the moon by 1970
        are bedevilled by technical,
        financial and even political
        troubles.

        It now appears that the first
        manned orbital flight of the two-seater
        Gemini spacecraft will be delayed
        from late next year into 1964.

        Space Agency officials say the
        problem is basically technical.
        Firms working under contract to
        produce the highly complex equipment
        required are running into unforeseen
        difficulties.

        Dr. James Webb, head of the
        National Aeronautics and Space
        Administration, is faced with
        escalating costs and delays. He has
        decided not to ask Congress for
        extra funds during the current
        financial year, which ends on
        June 30.

        To keep within his present
        budget, Dr. Webb has had to cut
        down on a host of Space Administration
        projects. Scientific satellites,
        the futuristic Nova super-rocket
        and the manned orbiting
        space station project have all been
        cut back. So have communications
        satellites.

        Some members of Congress are
        beginning to question the rapidly
        growing cost of the moon programme.
        This week Mr. Holifield,
        the California Democrat, who
        heads the powerful Senate-House
        Atomic Energy Committee, complained
        of "moon madness."

        # 6 MORE SPIES IN THE SKY

        ## U.S. LAUNCHINGS

        By Our Air Staff

        The American Air Force has
        secretly 20 unidentified satellites
        since last November Flight International,
        said to-day. It estimated
        that there were 12 Discoverer-type
        satellites, six Samos and one
        Midas. One failed to orbit.

        Samos contain television reconnaissance
        devices which are believed
        to be capable of carrying on
        the work of the banned U2 planes.
        Midas satellites carry infra-red
        sensors that can record rocket
        motor discharges at ranges of
        6,000 miles.

        America announced all satellite
        launchings until March, when the
        Russians refused to give details of
        theirs.

        # SPACE RADIATION RISE CONFIRMED

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Sunday.

        Dr. James Van Allen, of Iowa
        University, confirmed yesterday
        that an American high-altitude
        nuclear test over the Pacific on
        July 9 created an artificial radiation
        belt in the lower reaches of
        the Van Allen Belt. He said
        variations in radiation were studied
        for a year using the satellite
        Injun III.

        A scientist at the High Altitude
        Observatory, Boulder, Colorado,
        said the test was detected by
        radio-frequency signals which
        might interfere with some radio
        astronomy. The Van Allen radiation
        belt, encircling the earth from
        600 miles to a possible 100,000
        miles up, was discovered by Dr.
        Van Allen in 1958.

        WILL Cape Canaveral,
        heart of America's
        Space effort, be forced to
        move?

        This is the question
        being debated at top level
        here because of the Soviet
        build-up in Castro's Cuba,
        only ninety miles from
        the Florida coast.

        So far as President
        Kennedy has said, Cape
        Canaveral is not "under
        the gun."

        The missiles Castro is
        getting from Moscow for
        anti-aircraft defence have
        a range of only twenty-five
        miles.

        ## Worry

        His radar sets are fifteen
        years out of date.

        But what is worrying
        defence officials is that
        Russia's Krushchev could
        use Cuba for some super
        snooping.

        So far the Russians
        have only been able to
        monitor Canaveral rockets
        from submarines and
        trawlers.

        A land-based monitoring
        station would offer all
        kinds of opportunities---including
        the possibility of
        electronically destroying
        rockets on their pads or
        altering their course.

        THE RAF is to put three of
        the four main Thor nuclear
        ballistic missile stations to
        other uses when the missiles
        are scrapped next year. A
        fourth station will be closed.

        There are 60 Thors in Britain.
        The main bases are at Hemswell,
        Lincs; Driffield, Yorks; Feltwell,
        Norfolk, and North Luffenham,
        Rutland. Each base has four
        satellites so that not more than
        three missiles are in any one place.

        More than 150 civilians at Hemswell
        were given six months' notice
        last night. The station due for
        closure is Driffield. A small maintenance
        staff will be retained.
        About 160 civilians are likely to
        lose their jobs.

        About 1,000 R.A.F. men and 100
        permanent civil servants at each
        station will be found other jobs.
        No firm decision has been made on
        the future use of Hemswell, Feltwell
        and North Luffenham. All
        the satellite sites will be scrapped.

        ## 1,500 MILES RANGE

        Thor has an explosive head
        equivalent to one million tons of
        TNT and has a range of over 1,500
        miles. Its range could have been
        increased with later marks.

        The reason for Britain scrapping
        the missiles is financial. The RAF
        estimate that Thor would be a
        useful addition to the deterrent
        until the end of 1964.

        Even with no protection, 20 different
        sites, miles apart, impose a
        serious problem for the Russians.
        They must all be destroyed, absolutely
        instantaneously, for if there
        were even seconds between impacts
        three additional Russian cities
        would be destroyed.

        # MAGNETIC FIELD MEASURED

        ## MILKY WAY GALAXY

        By Our Science Correspondent

        Jodrell Bank scientists have
        measured for the first time the
        strength of the magnetic field in
        the Milky Way galaxy. Sir Bernard
        Lovell has said that he is thrilled
        with the success of this work.

        The existence of a magnetic field
        in our galaxy has been postulated.
        But the measurement of it, and the
        proof that it exists, has been beyond
        the powers of science.

        Jodrell Bank's giant telescope
        was used for 2,000 hours to listen
        to a source of radio waves coming
        from an area in a different part of
        the galaxy. The waves had to pass
        through a cloud of inter-stellar gas,
        proving by the effect of the gas
        on the waves that the waves had
        also passed through a magnetic
        field.

        # SIAM TO GET U.S. GUIDED MISSILES

        BANGKOK, Friday.

        Gen. Thanom Kittikachorn,
        Siamese Defence Minister, said in
        Bangkok yesterday that the United
        States would give Siam Sidewinder
        guided missiles. They are included
        in the special military aid promised
        last month.

        The aid will also include
        M-41 tanks, T-28 planes and

        # Astronaut Space Lines To Be Ordered by NASA

        HOUSTON (UPI)---Two important
        pieces of space equipment, including
        astronaut "umbilical lines"
        that will allow him to leave his
        spaceship, will be ordered this
        week by the manned spacecraft
        center.

        Proposals will be opened Friday
        on the study contract for the lines,
        a complex piece of hose that will
        provide fuel and electricity for any
        equipment when the astronaut
        leaves the ship during flight or
        after a moon landing.

        Earlier in the week the center
        will open proposals for a meshed
        fabric that will serve as the Apollo
        moonship seats.

        ## METEORITE HUNT

        ## One-ton fragments

        A UNITED STATES Government
        helicopter is to search
        this week for fragments of several
        meteorites of unusual size which
        have fallen in Virginia this month.
        Two are believed to have each
        weighed more than one ton.

        Astronomers put advertisements
        in local papers asking for information
        about the arrivals of the
        meteorites. They have had more
        than 100 replies, which have helped
        them to pinpoint the spots where
        the objects landed.

        # 'Space Walking' Predicted by '65

        WASHINGTON (AP) --- Within
        two or three years an American
        astronaut may open a hatch in his
        orbiting vehicle and step out into
        space.

        He may spend as much as 15
        minutes floating around, 87 to 150
        miles above the earth, before re-entering
        his spacecraft.

        Astronaut Virgil I. Grissom described
        the mission in a talk here
        which made it plain that he hoped,
        with proper luck in the draw of
        assignments, to be one of the first
        men to "walk" around in space.

        Grissom told members of the Society
        of Experimental Test Pilots
        that each of the two pilots aboard
        the Gemini spacecraft will wear
        a new type of pressurized suit.
        The life-supporting atmosphere
        within the suit will be augmented
        by an oxygen back pack.

        The two crew members will take
        turns spending brief periods outside
        the Gemini craft during the
        days and weeks that they orbit
        the earth. They will maintain contact
        with the vehicle by means of
        a rope or cable, as a safeguard
        against drifting too far away.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration has ordered
        12 Gemini craft for flights starting
        possibly late next year.

        After an initial unmanned flight,
        there will be an 18-orbit manned
        mission, and then two manned
        flights of two weeks or more.

        On the fifth Gemini flight, crews
        will start practicing rendezvous in
        orbit with an Agena target vehicle
        32 feet long and 5 feet in diameter.

        The walk-about space experiments
        will not begin until after
        the rendezvous practice missions.

        The Gemini vehicle will be 7½
        feet wide at the base.

        Grissom said the Gemini craft
        will have an ejection seat escape
        system much like that of a jet
        airplane, for use in an emergency
        at launching or on the approach
        to a landing.

        ## Grissom Hopes to Fly

        Either the pilot or the copilot
        can fire both ejection seats, but
        normally the copilot would do it
        only if the pilot was unable to give
        the ejection order.

        Grissom said he hoped to fly
        Gemini missions, but no decisions
        had yet been made as to who could
        go on the flights, or when.

        The astronaut said the new pressure
        suits would protect Gemini
        crews from radiation and from
        micrometeorites.

        He was asked whether his colleague,
        Walter Schirra, encountered
        any damaging radiation during
        his six-orbit flight last month.

        Persons attending the dinner
        meeting said Lt Col John A. Powers,
        information officer for the
        Mercury astronauts, told Grissom
        not to answer that question.

        # ROCKET ALARM MEETS SNAGS

        ## "Midas" system seriously delayed

        By Air Cdre. E. M. DONALDSON,
        Daily Telegraph Air Staff

        THE American "Midas"
        (Missile Defence Alarm
        System) which would give
        Britain an extra two minutes
        warning of a rocket attack,
        has run into difficulties. This
        means the system, designed to
        operate in 1970, will be
        seriously delayed.

        The major problem is that the
        system based on infra-red sensors
        in satellites orbiting the earth at
        2,000 miles has become too complicated.
        Mr. McNamara, the
        American Secretary of Defence,
        has ordered the whole "Midas"
        programme to be reorientated to
        simplify and improve reliability.

        "Midas" can detect a rocket
        launched 6,000 miles away, but it
        now seems it has difficulty in distinguishing
        a rocket-launch from
        the reflection of the sun on high
        altitude clouds in certain conditions.

        # 3 THEORIES MAY ALL BE RIGHT

        By ANTHONY SMITH,
        Daily Telegraph Science Correspondent

        NO one knows yet which
        idea about the universe is
        correct. Astronomical observations
        are not yet sufficiently
        accurate, said Prof. D. E.
        LITTLEWOOD, Profesor of Pure
        Mathematics, Bangor.

        But the near future could make
        discrimination possible, he added.
        At the moment there are three
        basic ideas, any one of which could
        be proved right.

        Apart from the two main ideas,
        known as the steady state and the
        big bang, there is also the elastic
        scheme. In the last, the universe
        expands from a point to a maximum
        size. As soon as it reaches
        this size, it contracts again.

        ## STEADY STATE

        The steady state idea suggests
        that, apart from local irregularities,
        the universe presents the same
        general aspect in all places and at
        all times.

        The expanding universe, with the
        idea of everything beginning with a
        big bang, is the third scheme.

        All theories might, it seems, be
        one and the same. It all depends,
        apparently, on what happens to
        time on the borders of the universe,
        which is said to stand still.

        ## Minuteman Always Ready

        # ICBM Gets Liaison Team

        ANAHEIM, Calif. (UPI)---A unique team of experts
        is making sure the Air Force's new Minuteman
        intercontinental ballistic missiles will always
        be ready for instant use, it was disclosed here.

        Each member of the REACT team is a senior
        technical engineer and familiar with the complete
        Minuteman weapon system. As such, they are
        capable of quick and accurate analysis of any major
        problem that arises.

        REACT, which means rapid evaluation and corrective
        team, is composed of representatives from
        North American, Aviation's autonetics team, Space
        Technology Laboratories, Boeing Co. and RCA.

        The Air Force explained the reason for formation
        of the REACT team was to expedite solving unusual
        system failures with the missiles.

        In the past, when unusual failures occurred
        design engineers were called into the field to
        analyze problems and to recommend corrective
        action. A certain amount of delay resulted because
        these engineers were only familiar with their own
        equipment rather than the overall weapon system.

        Using the unique REACT concept, such a team
        is capable of almost immediate attention to the
        overall Minuteman system problems.

        Later this year the Minuteman missile will join
        this country's growing deterrent power when the
        first wing of the solid-fuel, inertially guided
        ICBMs are installed in underground silos at
        Malmstrom Air Force Base, Great Falls, Mont.

        are under construction in various
        parts of the Soviet Union, according to
        Prof. Alexander A. Mikhailov, chairman
        of the USSR Academy of Sciences Council
        for Astronomy. Soviet Russia has 36
        astronomical observatories in operation
        now.

        New observatories are being built in
        Azerbaidzhan, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine,
        Novosibirsk, Irkutsk and Tartu. Mikhailov
        said the Tartu facility will become

        # £114M CONTRACT FOR MOON ROCKET

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Tuesday.

        The American Space Agency
        awarded the largest contract in its
        history to-day to the North American
        Aviation Company. This was
        for the production of the second
        stages of the advanced Saturn
        moon rocket. The contract is
        worth £114 million. America hopes
        to send a three-man Apollo capsule
        round the moon and back in
        1966.

        The agency also announced that
        its Mariner II spacecraft is about
        half way to its "meeting" with
        Venus. The spacecraft is due to
        pass Venus at a distance of 20,900

        # RUSSIA'S FIVE SPACE PROBE 'FAILURES'

        ## PLANET SHOTS

        WASHINGTON, Thursday.

        RUSSIA'S failure at the
        week-end to match
        America's achievement in
        sending a space probe towards
        Venus may mean that she will
        be unable to catch up until
        1964. The American Mariner
        II satellite will pass within
        9,000 miles of Venus on
        Dec. 14.

        The unannounced attempt by
        Russia on Saturday ended with her
        satellite orbiting the earth. It was
        still attached to the booster rocket
        which put it there.

        This was disclosed late last night
        by Mr. James Webb, Administrator
        of the National Aeronautics and
        Space Agency. He said Russia had
        had only one partial success out
        of six attempts since 1960 to
        "probe" Venus or Mars.

        ## VENUS POSITION

        Venus will be in a suitable position
        to the earth only until the
        middle of this month, unless extremely
        powerful rockets are used
        to launch a satellite. The next favourable
        opportunity will come early
        in 1964.

        Both countries use the "parking
        orbit" technique, putting the
        satellite into orbit round the earth
        before giving it the final "kick"
        to send it on a course that will
        bring it close to the planet.

        Mr. Webb said the following
        Russian attempts had been made:

        OCT. 10, 1960.---An attempt to
        probe Mars failed before parking
        orbit was achieved.

        OCT. 14, 1960.---A similar failure.

        FEB. 4, 1961.---In an attempted
        Venus probe the satellite was
        "parked" but could not be
        ejected into the planned Venus
        trajectory. Russia announced it
        as an earth satellite.

        FEB. 12, 1961.---A 1,400lb satellite
        was launched towards Venus. Its
        radio failed after 4,500,000 miles.

        AUG. 25, 1962.---A satellite again
        failed to eject from the main
        space craft in its parking orbit.

        SEPT. 1. 1962.---The same thing
        happened. The whole assembly
        is still orbiting the earth.

        ## KENNEDY SECRECY

        Mr. Webb said in a letter to the
        chairmen of the Senate and House
        space committees that his information
        came from various government
        agencies. Since early last year the
        Kennedy Administration has
        clamped secrecy on methods used
        to identify Russian space launchings.

        The partial disclosure of the results
        followed Congressional complaints
        that world opinion was getting
        a lopsided view of the space
        race. America admitted failures
        and Russia did not.

        By MIRROR REPORTER

        A GIANT TV station
        in Space, transmitting
        educational programmes
        to underdeveloped
        countries,
        was forecast yesterday.

        The plan was revealed by
        Dr. Donald Bond, of the
        Radio Corporation of
        America, at an international
        conference on
        satellite communications
        in London.

        American experts had
        found that it is possible
        for a satellite to beam
        three TV programmes
        over an area of 4,000,000
        square miles, said Dr.
        Bond.

        Programmes could be sent
        to the satellite from a
        central transmission
        station on earth.

        ## Languages

        For multi-language countries,
        the picture could be
        accompanied by a number
        of different languages
        on a separate
        sound chanel.

        "This could be a great contribution
        from the West
        to the underdeveloped
        countries," Dr. Bond
        added. "We think it is
        technically possible to
        establish such a system
        within the next ten
        years."

        Dr. Bond is one of 270
        scientists attending the
        conference from fourteen
        countries.

        The scientists were told
        that British Post Office
        engineers believe that a
        satellite communications
        system will be in full
        operational use within six
        years.

        ## MOON THEORY

        ## "Formed independently"

        DR. HAROLD UREY, Nobel
        Prize winner, said to-day that
        many scientists believe, through
        lunar studies and mathematical
        calculations, that the moon was
        formed independently of the earth.

        He told a conference of more
        than 200 lunar scientists and space
        physicists at Blacksburg, Virginia,
        that it now appears likely the moon
        was "captured" by the earth early
        in the history of the solar system.
        Shortly afterwards the moon was
        bombarded by earth satellites.

        # Japan, NASA To Cooperate

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---The
        United States and Japan have announced
        an agreement to cooperate
        in testing communication
        satellites.

        The agreement was signed by
        the National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration (NASA) and
        the Japanese of Postal and Telecommunications
        Ministry.

        Japan will supply a ground station
        capable of communicating via
        artificial satellite. The satellites
        will be launched by NASA.

        Similar agreements have been
        made with France, Great Britain,
        West Germany, Italy and Brazil.

        The agreement with Japan was
        concluded in an exchange of notes.
        It provides that transmissions
        through the communication satellites
        will be used for test purposes
        only and not for commercial exploitation.

        They will include demonstrations
        of satellite telephone, radio, television,
        and photograph transmissions
        through domestic telecommunication
        networks.

        NEW YORK, Tuesday.

        AMERICAN astronaut Walter
        Schirra, due to go into
        orbit on October 3 and circle
        the earth six times, may be the
        last U.S. spaceman but one to
        take a solo ride in space.

        If Schirra's nine-hour flight
        goes according to plan the
        Space Agency will give serious
        thought to cutting back the
        one-man Mercury Project
        flights and instead press on
        with longer missions involving
        the Gemini two-man capsules.

        At present four 18-orbit 24-hour-long
        Mercury missions
        are listed to follow Schirra's
        flight.

        But space officials are now
        considering dispensing with
        all but one of the 18-orbit
        flights.

        ## Next Year

        The Gemini capsule, capable
        of maintaining two men aloft
        for about a week, is expected
        to be ready for manned flight
        about this time next year.

        There are believed to be two
        reasons for the possible reduction
        of the Mercury flights:

        Little new is likely to be
        learned by continuing flights
        in the well-tried one-man
        spacecraft; and

        Scientists are understood to
        be anxious to switch from the
        Atlas booster to the Titan II,
        the more powerful rocket
        which will launch the Geminis.

        ## Four In A Row

        Privately, space scientists feel
        that by continuing to use the
        Atlas they are pressing their
        luck. Statistics show that the
        Atlases' record of reliability on
        launch is currently running at
        about 70 per cent.

        So far Project Mercury has
        had four successful Atlas
        launches---two manned and
        two unmanned---in a row.

        But by statistical law an
        accident is inevitable one day.

        ## SPACE ARMS RACE

        ## Minister's promise

        AMERICA did not plan to put
        "any weapons of mass
        destruction into orbit," Mr.
        Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of
        Defence, said yesterday. An arms
        race in outer space would not help
        America's security.

        "I can think of no greater
        stimulus for a Russian thermonuclear
        arms effort in space than
        a United States commitment to
        such a programme," he said to
        industrial and university representatives
        at South Bend, Indiana.

        ADELAIDE, Thursday.

        Prof. Hoyle, the British expert
        on solar physics, said in Adelaide
        to-day that what had been accomplished
        so far in the space race was
        not worth one thousandth of what
        had been spent.

        The United States Mariner spaceship,
        now on its way to Venus,
        would not give any information
        that could not have been found out
        far cheaper by sending up a telescope
        with a high-altitude balloon.

        The results of research in radio
        astronomy in Sydney were worth
        far more than the whole of the
        American space programme.
        Nothing, for instance, "has been
        discovered to compare with
        Einstein's theory of relativity."---Reuter.

        # Lifting by balloons to 80,000ft

        FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT
        NEW YORK, Monday.

        AMERICAN scientists are
        to float a giant telescope
        80,000ft above the Earth early
        next year. It will give the
        closest view so far of stars and
        planets and will help to decide
        whether or not there is life on
        Mars.

        Two balloons will lift the six-ton
        telescopic apparatus from the
        balloon flight stations at Palestine,
        Texas, in February or March. At
        that time Mars will be particularly
        close to the earth.

        The telescope, called Stratoscope
        II, will have sharper vision
        than the 200-inch telescope on the
        top of Mount Palomar, California.
        It will be able to pick out an
        object six inches wide at a distance
        of 1,000 miles.

        ## TELEVISION LINK

        It will be radio-controlled from
        a mobile van on the ground. Television
        will enable scientists to look
        directly through its sighting instruments
        and through the telescope
        itself.

        Each flight will last just one
        night. At dawn the balloons will
        lower the telescope to 5,000 feet
        when a helicopter will guide the
        apparatus to the ground.

        NEW YORK, Monday.

        AMERICAN space researchers and Government
        officials gave generous but uneasy praise to-day
        to the skills of the Russian scientists which made the
        space double possible.

        In the absence of more detailed
        information out of Moscow
        there was widespread
        speculation on the possible
        scientific and political significances
        of the achievement.

        And at the U.N some delegates
        were suggesting that Mr.
        Kruschev might seek to exploit
        the Russian triumph by again
        visiting New York next month
        for the opening of the 17th
        U.N. General Assembly.

        But against the fog of speculation
        there was solid agreement
        that the Russian achievement
        has eclipsed the recent
        American successes.

        ## Eyes On Moon

        The Americans will not
        even attempt a rendezvous in
        space for at least two years.
        By that time they hope to
        establish a meeting in orbit of
        a two-man Gemini space capsule
        and an Agena B rocket.

        It will be an essential stepping
        stone in their preparations
        for the eventual moon trip
        aboard a three-man Apollo
        space craft.

        During the American moon
        flight---which will not take
        place before 1967 at the earliest---the
        craft which actually lands
        on the moon will rendezvous
        with its "mother ship" in orbit
        around the moon for the return
        journey to earth.

        ## At The Cape

        The two Russian space men
        came close to a perfect rendezvous.

        At Cape Canaveral there
        was some disagreement on
        whether the double flight put
        the Russians far ahead of the
        Americans in the actual race
        to the moon.

        Dr. Krafft Ehricke, Director
        of Advanced Studies at the
        Astronautics Institute in San
        Diego, appeared to believe it
        did.

        But the Deputy Director of
        the American Moon Programme---Project
        Apollo---Dr.
        Eberhard Rees disagreed.

        NEW YORK, Saturday.

        For the fifth time in succession,
        an advanced model of the Polaris
        submarine missile went out of
        control after a test launch from
        Cape Canaveral early this afternoon
        and had to be destroyed.
        Model is the A-3 which is being
        developed to increase the range of
        Polaris missiles to 2,875 miles, as
        compared with the present 1,725
        miles.

        WASHINGTON (UPI)---President
        Kennedy has informed Congress
        that "significant progress" has
        been made in the nation's all-out
        drive to win the space race.

        The claim was included in the
        sixth semiannual report to Congress
        by the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration (NASA).

        It said NASA is giving "highest
        priority" to the projects leading
        to manned exploration of the moon
        as urged by both Mr. Kennedy
        and Congress. The report said
        plans call for reaching the moon
        by the late 1960s.

        The report on activity from
        July 1, 1961, through Dec. 31, 1961,
        said that achievements ranged
        from big gains in new scientific
        knowledge to demonstration of
        high performance by the space
        systems.

        Short Bros. have offered the
        Army a mobile version of the
        Navy's Sea Cat low level anti-aircraft
        guided missile. Named Tiger
        Cat, a full scale model is on show
        at Farnborough.

        The Army is seeking a replacement
        for the L.70 Bofors. The
        British PT.428, a highly sophisticated
        system, was recently cancelled
        on the grounds of expense,
        leaving the Army apparently
        dependent on the American Mauler
        system.

        Tiger Cat may not fully meet all
        the Army's operational requirements.
        For one thing it is subsonic,
        but it has a number of
        advantages.

        It is comparatively cheap and has
        already been fully developed for
        the Navy. It can be integrated
        with the existing L.70 Bofors-Yellow
        Fever radar system, and so
        integrated has a lethality advantage
        over the Bofors of five to one.

        WASHINGTON (AP) --- The
        United States has agreed to sell
        antiaircraft missiles to Israel in
        an effort to restore the Middle
        East power balance, upset by
        heavy deliveries of Soviet arms
        to Israel's Arab neighbors.

        The missiles --- with deliveries
        probably beginning in about a
        year --- are Army Hawks.

        The have a ground-to-air striking
        range of about 25 miles and a
        homing device which guides them
        to the target at supersonic
        speeds.

        Diplomatic officials said the
        United States will keep the
        Middle East arms situation under
        close observation.

        U.S. officials say that the decision
        to sell missiles does not involve
        any real change in policy.
        However, Israel first requested
        short-range antiaircraft missiles
        in 1959. The request got nowhere.

        In early 1961 Russia began
        stepping up deliveries of modern
        arms to Egypt and other Arab
        countries. These include high-speed
        jet fighter planes and long-range
        jet bombers of a type
        known as TU16, which have an
        operating radius of 1,800 miles.

        In recent years the United
        States has sold some arms to both
        Israel and various Arab states.
        It has tried to limit such sales,
        officials said, to strictly defensive
        weapons such as small arms, radar
        equipment, communications
        gear and the like.

        Israel's major arms suppliers
        have been U.S. allies, notably
        France.

        The United States has declared
        that the objective of its policy is
        to prevent an imbalance of military
        power as between Israel and
        the Arab states.

        # Town M.P.'s "Space Post"

        MR PAUL WILLIAMS, M.P. for
        Sunderland South, has been
        elected Vice-Chairman of a new
        aero-space sub-committee set up
        by Conservative M.P.s. The sub-committee
        of the Conservatives'
        Parliamentary Aviation Committee
        will watch developments
        in space research.

        Mr Williams takes a great
        interest in space development,
        and frequently questions
        Ministers in the Commons.

        Britain is at present collaborating
        with other European
        countries to develop a launcher
        for space satellites, using the
        British rocket, Blue Streak, as
        the first stage element. The
        Ministry of Aviation says it
        would have doubled the cost to
        have made an all-British
        launcher.

        # COST OF SPACE

        PRESIDENTIAL addresses to the British Association
        for the Advancement of Science are found not
        seldom to have over-reached their object in
        prophecies either of inspissated gloom or untrammelled
        optimism. Sir JOHN COCKCROFT at yesterday's
        meeting in Manchester did neither. For this, in an
        age of dazzling scientific virtuosity in space, we
        should perhaps be grateful. His views on space
        travel as distinct from space research were nothing
        if not platonic. Misjudged enthusiasm in such a
        field entails the risk of completely open-ended
        expenditure. We must manage our outlay differently
        from the United States or Russia. This should not
        mean that we should leave everything to the giants,
        but that we should not try to rival their expenditure.

        Even though we firmly eschew all thoughts of
        British-sponsored trips to the moon, there is more
        to be done in the field of space research on grounds
        of national interest than we can hope effectively
        to cope with single handed. Whether by luck or
        good management this is something we have not
        attempted to do. It is not that our space developments
        have been exactly costless. But at least we
        have sought to make them international affairs. Sir
        JOHN referred to the launching, with American
        co-operation, of the British satellite within which a
        number of experiments are now proceeding. And
        there is the further prospect that the European Space
        Research Organisation will soon take shape.

        We are reminded that our commitment here will
        take a sizeable slice of our budget for basic research.
        If we are to make a really serious effort in space
        developments, it had clearly best be done within
        this European context. Moreover, we should not
        be deterred by the fact that the French, West
        Germans and Italians are also planning projects of
        their own. What we have to ensure, however, is
        that while putting our full weight behind this
        co-operative endeavour, we do not, as Sir JOHN
        emphasised, reduce the funds available for basic
        research in our universities in times of financial
        stringency.

        EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE,
        Calif. (AP)---The X15 Rocket ship's
        mighty engine has been given its
        longest workout aloft---127 seconds.
        The previous high was 120 seconds.

        Space agency test pilot John B.
        McKay flew to an altitude of 67,000
        feet and hit a maximum speed of
        2,693 miles per hour.

        McKay was testing three factors---heat
        transfer rates over the X15's
        metal skin; stability with its ventral
        fin---part of the tail---removed;
        and ability of a newly designed
        cockpit window to withstand heat.

        To maintain the long burning
        time, McKay held the engine's
        power to 75 per cent of maximum
        thrust for the first 75 seconds
        after it was dropped from the
        B52 mother ship. Then it cut it
        to 40 per cent.

        ## 10-Minute Flight

        He landed at 10:14 a.m. after a
        10-minute flight.

        Normally, the 57,000-pound thrust
        engine is operated at maximum
        power.

        McKay flew the rocket craft at
        low angles of attack---an average 3
        degrees---and at relatively low air
        speeds.

        Sensors on the surface of the
        craft checked the heat buildup.

        Knowledge of the plane's ability
        to withstand heat will be valuable
        in designing future spacecraft for
        reentry into the earth's atmosphere.

        AMERICA has successfully
        launched
        more than 20 SECRET
        satellites this year, it
        is revealed today.

        Russia has sent up seven
        hush-hush sputniks.

        Some of the American
        satellites are no longer in
        orbit. But others are
        still circling Earth and
        carrying out undisclosed
        duties.

        The figures are given by
        the British aeronautical
        magazine, Flight, which
        publishes a table of
        successful American and
        Soviet Space launchings.

        Earlier this week Sir
        Bernard Lovell, director
        of the radio-telescope
        station at Jodrell Bank,
        said he knew America
        had launched at least 12
        unmanned satellites in
        secret.

        Today's figures increase
        world speculation about
        the use of satellites for
        military purposes.

        All the secret American
        satellites listed by
        "Flight" were launched
        by the Air Force.

        "Flight" comments: "Military
        undertakings bedevil
        the scientific recording of
        man's entry into Space."

        # Army Gets First Supply Of Pershing Equipment

        ORLANDO, Fla. (Special)---The
        Army has announced that it has
        accepted---ahead of schedule---the
        first tactical Pershing missile
        equipment.

        The Pershing equipment will be
        issued to artillery and ordnance
        units at Ft. Sill, Okla., and Redstone
        Arsenal, Ala. Special ceremonies
        marking the delivery were
        conducted here recently with key
        contractor and Army officials
        participating.

        Delivery of the tactical equipment
        met, and bettered, a target
        date set by the Army four years
        ago. Delivery of the artillery
        equipment was a month ahead of
        schedule.

        Pershing, a selective range artillery
        missile, has undergone extensive
        flight testing at Cape
        Canaveral.

        Pershing is built by Martin
        Company's Orlando Division under
        the technical direction of the Army
        Missile Comd, Redstone Arsenal.

        Col O. M. Hirsch, Pershing
        weapon system manager for the
        Army, called delivery of the tactical
        equipment a "significant
        achievement for the Army and the
        entire contractor team."

        The 1st Arty has been activated
        at Ft. Sill and the 1st has been
        undergoing extensive training at
        the Guided Missile School at
        Redstone Arsenal.

        Pershing training equipment has
        been in the hands of the artillery
        school and 1st Missile Brigade at
        Ft. Sill and the guided missile
        school at Redstone Arsenal for
        many months.

        The tactical equipment turned
        over to the Army, however, is the
        first in this category.

        Pershing, a two-stage ballistic
        missile system capable of delivering
        nuclear warheads to ranges of
        several hundred miles, has been
        assigned to the field Army and
        Army Group Support Mission.

        # BLUE WATER DECISION WILL BE ON COST

        DAILY TELEGRAPH REPORTER

        IT is unlikely that the
        Government's decision on
        Blue Water will be made
        known before Parliament reassembles
        in October. If it is
        cancelled it will be on purely
        financial grounds.

        It is not in the same category as
        the intermediate range ballistic
        missile Blue Streak, which became
        obsolete during development. It
        leads the 70-mile range missiles.

        A decision not to proceed with
        Blue Water need not denote a
        change in defence policy. Rhine
        Army at present has three types
        of nuclear weapons: Honest John,
        a free flight rocket due to be replaced
        by an improved version, the
        8in howitzer and the 70-mile
        Corporal.

        ## CORPORAL OBSOLETE

        Corporal is obsolete and is
        being replaced in the American,
        German and other allied armies by
        Sergeant. Since Sergeant is more
        expensive and tactically inferior to
        Blue Water, we will not buy it.

        As far as the tactics of I (Br)
        Corps are concerned, a decision not
        to proceed with Blue Water, standing
        alone, would have no effect.
        Corporal is an Army group weapon
        and the two Royal Artillery regiments
        which are armed with it are
        in general support of the Northern
        Army Group.

        If Britain is not to have Blue
        Water, she will be unable to provide
        the 70-mile range nuclear
        weapon required of her under
        MC 70, the current NATO plan.
        Support of units to be equipped

        WASHINGTON, Saturday.

        A THIRD American attempt
        to establish a ring of tiny
        metal filaments, or "dipoles,"
        round the earth will be made
        soon. This plan, known as
        Project West Ford, has been
        condemned by British and
        other scientists abroad as
        likely to harm astronomical
        observation.

        The purpose of the ring of
        "needles" is to see if such a device
        could serve as a long-range military
        communications system bouncing
        back radio signals. Before the
        first launching attempt, a committee
        of scientists studied foreign
        protests.

        Its report stated that a single
        filament belt would "probably not
        have an adverse effect on any
        branch of science." But it was
        "seriously concerned" lest a
        series of systems would harm
        optical and radio astronomical
        observations.

        In order to meet these objections
        future launchings will create a filament
        belt which will not last long.
        The canister containing the dipoles
        will release them only on command
        from the ground and only when the
        orbit guarantees a short life for the
        belt.

        # Energy beam as space weapon

        From Our Own Correspondent
        WASHINGTON, Saturday.

        Russia is believed to be engaged
        in a vigorous research and development
        programme for using a high
        energy Laser beam as a space
        weapon.

        Gen. Schriever, head of the Air
        Force Systems Command, says
        that Lasers could have destructive
        and lethal effects on space vehicles.

        Gen. Schriever recently told the
        House of Representatives operations
        sub-committee that he would
        not recommend research and development
        on active space weapons
        at present, but both he and Gen.
        Lemay, Air Force chief of staff,
        have expressed concern lest Russia
        beat the United States in development
        of military space vehicles.

        "If we can't deal with such
        satellites the ability of this nation
        to exist and preserve its essential
        values will be severely compromised
        or non-existent, Gen. Schriever said.

        # SERVICE THIS YEAR

        By Our Air Staff

        The Blue Steel stand-off flying
        nuclear bomb will be in RAF service
        this year. Mr. Fraser, Air
        Minister, said so in a written Commons
        reply yesterday.

        Already many V-bomber crews
        are fully trained in using Blue
        Steel. The training has been done
        on a weapon put at Bomber Command's
        disposal.

        The Blue Steel now entering service
        is very different from its
        original conception. Its range is
        now measured in hundreds of miles.

        It navigates and penetrates at
        very great height and at several
        times the speed of sound. Then it
        strikes its target in a vertical dive.
        Its warhead is at least one
        megaton.

        # SPUTNIK THEORY

        ## Fragment unidentified

        SCIENTISTS at the Smithsonian
        Astrophysical Observatory,
        Cambridge, Massachusetts, were
        unable to confirm to-day that a
        piece of metal which two policemen
        found in a Wisconsin street
        was part of the Russian Sputnik
        IV. The fragment, weighing
        20lb, is shaped like a giant bottlecap.

        The observatory said the metal
        was definitely man-made but there
        were no markings to suggest which
        country it came from. The
        observatory is sending the fragment
        to the National Aeronautics
        and Space Administration in
        Washington.

        # Moon-Man Plan Called 'Like a Stunt'

        CHICAGO (AP) --- Lewis L.
        Strauss, former chairman of the
        Atomic Energy Commission, says
        the Administration's projected
        plan to place a man on the moon
        in 10 years "seems perilously like
        a stunt."

        Strauss said the Department of
        Defense "has said that there will
        be no weapon development connected
        with it." And, he added, if
        its value "to merely impress others
        as a scientific achievement is questionable,
        what is left seems perilously
        like a stunt."

        He told a dinner of the United
        Republican Fund of Illinois that
        the stated overall cost of the project
        is about $20 billion. He added:

        "Let me guess that, from some
        experience with government spending
        on new projects, the final
        figure is more likely to be some
        multiple of 20 billion."

        Strauss said he does not oppose
        "if it is conducted in coordination
        with military necessity."

        ADELAIDE, Australia (AP)---The
        largest rocket ever launched
        in Australia was fired at Woomera.

        The two-stage Knight rocket
        reached an altitude of 380 miles.
        Fragments of the rocket reentering
        the atmosphere made a brilliant
        display visible for more than
        100 miles.

        Minister for Supply Alen Fairhall
        said the experiments would
        give information on the composition
        and properties of the ionosphere,
        a vital factor in long range

        CAPE CANAVERAL (UPI)---The
        U.S. Air Force fired its mightiest
        rocket, the Titan II, 5,000 miles
        across the Atlantic Friday for its
        fourth success in six shots.

        The launching was called a "full
        success" for the 103-foot rocket,
        which will be able to hurl a giant
        nuclear warhead halfway around
        the world when it becomes operational.

        The Titan II has been tabbed as
        the booster for the two-man Gemini
        space capsules, scheduled to be
        launched into orbit around the
        earth starting late next year.

        Within 30 minutes after launching
        the nose cone had plunged
        into its planned target area near
        Ascension Island, off the west
        coast of Africa.

        NEW YORK, Friday.

        AMERICAN delegate Mr.
        Francis Plimpton produced
        a 14lb. piece of
        Sputnik 4 from a cardboard
        box at the UN today and
        offered it to the Soviet delegate
        as a "concrete gesture
        of co-operation."

        The Russian, Mr. Platon
        Morozov, had just finished
        another speech in the Committee
        on Peaceful Uses of
        Outer Space, denouncing U.S.
        policy.

        He made no attempt to
        accept the gift and said
        severely: "These dramatic
        means are utilised here to divert
        our attention from great and
        important issues."

        Mr. Plimpton said the piece
        landed in an empty street in
        Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on September
        5.

        ## A hole

        It was taken to the Smithsonian
        Astrophysical Laboratory
        in Washington, where
        scientists cut off a 6lb. piece for
        study.

        When they left the chamber
        Mr. Morozov called the incident
        "a circus trick."

        Mr. Plimpton said: "We
        might have a claim against the
        Soviet Union, as it made a hole
        in the street."

        NEW YORK (AP)---Launching
        of a second experimental Telstar
        communications satellite has been
        delayed until at least the end of
        the year. It may not be launched
        at all.

        This was reported by the American
        Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
        sponsor of Telstar.

        Two factors enter into the situation.

        First, AT&T has made its rocket
        booster available to the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        to orbit before the end of the
        year a satellite that will study a
        radiation belt caused by a hydrogen
        bomb the United States exploded
        last July.

        The booster would not be available
        for a Telstar until after that
        time.

        Secondly, AT&T executives are
        weighing in the meantime whether
        it would be feasible to spend about
        $3 million to launch Telstar II on
        an experimental basis in view of
        the vast amount of scientific information
        already gained from Telstar
        I.

        The question is whether enough
        additional information would be
        gained to warrant the cost. A decision
        has not been reached, officials
        said.

        ## No Income

        A spokesman for AT&T stressed
        that the question of commercial
        feasibility was not involved. He
        said the company derived no income
        from Telstar I, nor would
        it from Telstar II, because both
        are in the experimental rather
        than commercial category.

        Telstars will be sent aloft later
        on a commercial basis under a
        new law creating a combined government-private
        corporation for
        control of a Telestar communications.

        NEW YORK (UPI) --- James E.
        Webb said here, "We seek space
        power as a deterrent to any potential
        adversary who might attempt
        to exploit space as an
        avenue of aggression against us."

        Webb, chief of the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        (NASA), told the Explorers
        Club here, "We are mobilizing our
        national resources---material, physical,
        and intellectual---to make us
        first in space."

        He said mastery of space,
        whether by this country or Russia,
        "will not be determined by any
        single achievement---even one so
        advanced as exploration of the
        moon."

        This will be determined, he said,
        by scientific knowledge and technical
        ability. He said the United
        States is striving to accumulate
        such knowledge and ability.

        A method by which rich countries
        could relay television programmes
        to poor ones was outlined
        in London yesterday at an international
        conference on satellite
        communication. It would involve
        the launching of television relay
        stations which would hover permanently
        over under-developed but
        well-populated nations.

        In this way, and by the use of
        one orbiting transmitter which
        would have been placed there by a
        rich country's rocket, the whole
        area of the poor country beneath
        could receive its transmissions.
        The plan was described by Dr.
        Donald S. Bond, of the Radio
        Corporation of America.

        Education rather than entertainment
        would be the prime task of
        this single satellite. To cover an
        area of three or four million square
        miles, greater than that of most
        countries, the satellite would have
        to weigh about 6,000lb.

        To remain stationary above the
        earth it would have to be at a
        height of 23,000 miles.

        UNIVERSITY of Arizona astronomers
        believe that a moon
        crater recently announced by the
        Russians was actually discovered
        by the German astronomer Julius
        Franz 50 years ago.

        The American astronomers are
        also questioning pictures of "the
        Soviet mountains" taken by Russia's
        Lunik III spacecraft in 1959.

        NATO land forces in Central
        Europe are having their nuclear
        potential considerably augmented.
        These forces, which include the 1st
        (Br.) Corps, have been equipped
        with the latest type of Honest John
        rocket, which is more accurate and
        has a longer range than the
        previous ones.

        The German Army is raising six
        battalions to be equipped with the
        United States 25-85 mile Sergeant
        guided missile, which is replacing
        Corporal in the American Army.
        The first of these battalions should
        be operational by early summer.

        The failure of NATO countries
        to accept Blue Water, and opt for
        the inferior Sergeant, which led to
        Britain's decision not to fulfil her
        obligation to replace her Corporal
        missiles, has led to indecision
        among others on whether to buy
        Sergeant.

        WASHINGTON, Saturday.

        NEW data obtained from
        Telstar satellite has disclosed
        that the new radiation
        belt around the earth caused
        by the high altitude nuclear
        explosion of July 9 is greater
        than was originally calculated.

        The Defence Department and
        the Atomic Enegry Commission say
        in a joint statement today that it
        will not "constitute any hazard to
        manned satellite launchings we
        have planned in the near future."
        Its high density section lies above
        the planned orbits.

        The July 9 explosion created a
        belt of high energy electrons round
        the earth, similar to, and outside,
        the natural bands of radiation discovered
        by Dr. James van Allen.
        It has, therefore, been called "the
        little Van Allen Belt".

        ## BACKGROUND NOISE

        It was at first thought that the
        new belt would decay quickly, and
        disappear entirely by the end of this
        year or early next year. The new
        data shows that the belt's intensity
        at its higher altitudes is such that
        "it may persist for many years."

        At its lower altitude, however,
        the belt is disappearing, as shown
        by a continued reduction of radio
        background noise.

        The new belt caused electron
        damage to the solar cells of three
        United States launched satellites
        and put them out of operation.

        Telstar, which was designed to
        operate under high intensity radiation,
        has suffered no apparent
        damage.

        SYDNEY, Friday.

        THE existence of magnetic
        fields in outer space has
        been discovered by two radio
        astronomers attached to the
        Commonwealth Scientific Industrial
        Research Organisation.
        They believe the discovery
        provides a possible clue to the
        origin of the universe.

        Mr. Marcus Price, an American
        Fullbright scholar, and Mr. Brian
        Cooper, of Sydney, found and
        charted a field in the galaxy
        Centaurus A. The galaxy is 20 million
        light years from earth.

        The discovery gives strong weight
        to Prof. Fred Hoyle's theory of a
        steady state universe. It was made
        on the new giant radio telescope at
        Parkes, New South Wales.

        Leading Australian scientists
        said the discoveries established an
        Australian lead in radio astronomy,
        and also the superiority in power
        and accuracy of the Parkes telescope
        over Jodrell Bank.

        ## RADIO WAVES

        Mr. Cooper and Mr. Price said
        they found radio waves from Centaurus
        A linearly polarised. When
        they varied the frequencies of receiving
        signals, they found polarisation
        rotated.

        This effect, known as Faraday's
        rotation, proved the existence of a
        magnetic field.

        Prof. Hoyle, who is lecturing in
        Adelaide, spent several weeks with
        the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial
        Research Organisation's
        radio physics laboratory assessing
        the discovery and other information
        from the Parkes telescope.

        ## IMPORTANT ADDITION

        ## Universe theories

        A SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT
        writes: The great controversy of
        whether our universe is continuously
        expanding or is at a steady
        state has certainly received an
        important addition with the discovery
        of a strong magnetic field
        near Centaurus.

        One theory has it that all the
        universe was originally concentrated
        in one single ball, called the
        primieval atom by astronomers.
        This exploded, and showered matter
        into all directions, and thus we
        still observe to-day all stars receding
        from us.

        The second theory, of a steady
        state universe, believes in continuous
        creation of matter. This
        means that as fast as the stars
        recede from us, new matter is
        being created everywhere in the
        universe, just at the correct rate
        to account for the emptying effect
        of the expansion.

        This rate is not very large. It is
        about one atom of hydrogen per
        cubic mile of space per year.

        Only if matter were created in
        the universe, and then came together
        to form new stars, would
        large magnetic fields be found. But
        however valuable this new fact is
        to support the steady state theory,
        more will be needed before it will
        be accepted by all astronomers.

        THE Foreign Office has now
        confirmed that British policy
        on selling missiles in the Middle
        East is to be re-examined. During
        recent years our official policy
        has been, in their own words,
        "to do nothing which would contribute
        to an arms race in the
        area".

        This policy, although it was
        often more honoured in the
        breach than the observance by
        our arms manufacturers, was
        eminently sensible. Having taken
        a major part in producing the
        original Israel question, we were
        bound to attempt to keep it within
        bounds.

        Both Israel and Egypt, however,
        have recently tested missiles
        made by their own scientists, the
        former for allegedly peaceful
        purposes, the latter for the purpose
        of 'defence'.

        There are also believed to be
        Russian missiles in the area, probably
        in either Iraq or Egypt. For
        this reason the Americans are now
        allowing their manufacturers to
        sell missiles to Israel, a step as
        ill-advised as it is shortsighted.
        Not only does this introduce a new
        factor into the precarious balance
        of power in the area --- it also
        lays upon the West the stigma of
        being the first overtly to encourage
        this new arms race.

        Eager not to be left out of the
        pickings, therefore, our own
        Foreign Office is to re-examine
        our own sales in the area in the
        height of this "misunderstanding".
        Naturally enough our missile
        manufacturers would welcome
        this new outlet, which might help
        to ease the chronic troubles now
        affecting their factories.

        To sell missiles in this area
        would only accelerate the deterioration
        of a situation which is
        already frightening. If and when
        there is a war between Israel and
        the Arab states surrounding her,
        we should make sure that British
        missiles are not available for use.
        We may not be able to restrain
        either the Americans or the Russians
        in their folly, but sheer economic
        expediency should not
        tempt us to compound their error.

        Edwards Air Force Base, California, Saturday.

        EIGHT United States astronauts training at America's first
        "school for astronauts" will visit Britain next month as
        guests of the Empire Test Pilots' School, Farnborough. This
        will be another step toward the eventual training of Royal
        Air Force pilots as astronauts at America's mid-desert "space
        port."

        Earlier this year 88 senior R.A.F. test pilots and the Farnborough
        commandant visited the "school," officially called the
        Aerospace Research Pilots' School. They watched techniques for
        piloting future space planes such as Dynasoar X20, the 1,800
        m.p.h. orbital plane to be flight-tested by a team including an
        R.A.F. pilot next year, and for
        Moon and Mars voyages.

        Informal talks to obtain facilities
        for R.A.F. pilots to train in American
        astronautical sciences have
        already taken place here and in
        Washington.

        Sqdn. Ldr. Harry Archer, 35, of
        Edinburgh, senior R.A.F. test pilot
        at Edwards on the exchange
        scheme existing between British
        and American schools, is already
        involved in launches of high altitude
        flight missions of the X15
        rocket plane.

        ## "Mother ship" pilot

        Later this year he will be at the
        controls of the B52G intercontinental
        bomber which is the
        X15's "mother ship" when the
        aircraft makes its maximum
        altitude flight to 95 miles, or
        500,000 ft.

        Sqdn. Ldr. Archer's involvement
        in some of America's most secret
        aerospace projects is regarded here
        as being the start of a process
        which could well lead eventually
        to British-American astronaut
        crews voyaging together into space.

        Furthermore, the Empire Test
        Pilots' School is the only foreign
        establishment from which graduates,
        provided they have the
        requisite 2,000 hours test pilot
        experience and a test pilot engineering
        degree, can train in
        American astronautical sciences.

        Although the Air Ministry has
        not yet taken advantage of the
        opportunity, I understand at least
        one Briton will be included in the
        seven-month courses within the
        next 18 months.

        ## First Briton in space

        This officer, who will almost certainly
        be selected from the 22 men
        who came here earlier this year,
        will be Britain's first astronaut.
        His identity has not been revealed
        here.

        Another factor which is leading
        the United States Air Force to
        consider recruiting Britons for
        astronautical training is that the
        reservoir of pilots with the
        requisite experience within the
        United States "is not
        inexhaustible."

        An Air Force officer said to me:
        "With all their experience, their
        rigorous training, their experience
        of bad weather flying, all invaluable
        experience for the astronaut, the
        recruitment of Britons to co-operate
        in the United States space programme
        would seem to be a sensible
        movement.

        "At present we have as many
        men as we want, but as our space
        programmes expand we shall
        require more, and at this stage and
        at this level we would be delighted
        to have the English along."

        With the eight trainee astronauts
        on the visit will be seven
        instructors and their test pilot
        commandant, Col. Charles Yeager.

        CANOGA PARK, Calif. (AP) --- The
        J2 rocket engine, which will
        be used to power the United
        States' first space craft to the
        moon, successfully passed its first
        prolonged static test, builders have
        said.

        The J2, the most powerful
        hydrogen-oxygen engine now being
        tested in this country, ran at full
        thrust for 4 minutes at a field
        laboratory near Canoga Park the
        other day. It was designed and
        built by the Rocket-Dyne Division
        of North American Aviation Inc.

        Leland F. Belew, head of the
        Marshall Space Flight Center of
        Huntsville, Ala., said "It appears
        to have been a complete success.
        This is a major milestone in the
        J2 development program."

        ## Cluster of Five

        The J2 will be used in a cluster
        of five to propel the second stage
        of the Saturn C5 Apollo Moon
        Rocket. A single J2 engine will
        power the Saturn S4B, the top
        stage of the moon rocket.

        First flights of the Apollo moon
        craft are expected in the mid-1960s.
        The United States hopes to
        put the Apollo on the moon by the
        end of the decade.

        The J2 will have a thrust of
        200,000 pounds at its operating
        altitude.

        Rocket engines now in use, like
        the one that boosted Walter
        Schirra into orbit, are hydrocarbon
        engines which usually burn kerosene.

        Engines of the J2 type provide
        more than 30 per cent more thrust
        than the hydrocarbon engines,
        according to Rocket-Dyne officials.

        # Booster Recovery Kits

        Washington---All American Engineering
        Co. has received an $81,400 Army
        contract to design and test two recovery
        kits for Sikorsky H-37 helicopters to be
        used at White Sands Missile Range,
        N. M., for booster, drone and instrument
        package recovery.

        The new recovery systems will be capable
        of snatching packages weighing up to
        several thousand pounds, since rocket
        boosters launched at White Sands reach
        this weight. The contract calls for the
        system to be operational this fall.

        All American initially developed the
        system for the USAF Discoverer satellite
        program. It was later made a part of the
        recovery procedure for the camera pod
        carried on board the ballistic payload for
        the Echo 2 satellite launch.

        NEW YORK, Monday.

        THE United States announced
        the names to-day
        of nine new astronauts who
        will take part in the Appollo
        flights to the moon. All are
        married with children.

        The National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration said the men
        were chosen from 253 candidates.
        They are:

        Mr. NEIL A. ARMSTRONG, 32, a
        civilian formerly with the Navy;
        Major FRANK BORMAN, 34, Air
        Force; Lieut. CHARLES CONRAD,
        32, Navy; Lt.-Cdr. JAMES A.
        LOVELL, 34, Navy; Capt. JAMES
        A. MCDIVITT, 33, Air Force; Mr.
        ELLIOT M. SEE, 35, civilian; Capt.
        THOMAS P. STAFFORD, 32, Air
        Force; Capt. EDWARD H. WHITE,
        32, Air Force; Lt.-Cdr. JOHN W
        YOUNG, 31, Navy.

        ## TWO MEN IN ORBIT

        The new astronauts have an
        average flying time of 2,800 hours
        including 1,900 in jets. They are
        expected to be prime considerations
        for the Gemini project to put two
        men into orbit in a single capsule.

        This programme calls for a
        rendezvous in space by two
        vehicles, an important step before
        the Apollo moon project is put
        into operation. In the Apollo programme
        a three-man space capsule
        will be put into orbit round the
        moon.

        From this a two-man "bug"
        will leave for the moon's surface.

        The next American space flight
        will be made by Cdr. Walter
        Schirra on Sept. 28.

        COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.
        (UPI) --- The Army Air Defense
        Comd said the first Army National
        Guard units in North
        America to be armed with Nike
        Hercules missiles have moved to
        defense sites in the Washington-Baltimore
        defense area.

        Lt Gen William W. Dick Jr. of
        Colorado Springs, commander of
        the Army unit, said four National
        Guard batteries soon to become
        operational in the area represent
        the beginning of the Guard's on-site
        Hercules program.

        By 1965, he said, Army National
        Guard units will man more than
        one-third of the Army Air Defense
        Comd's nationwide force of combat-ready
        Nike Hercules units.

        The Army command provides
        surface-to-air missile units which
        are used by the North American
        Air Defense Comd (NORAD), headquartered
        here, for air defense of
        specified areas.

        ## Past Practice Followed

        Dick said active Army units, as
        in the past, will continue to man
        the bulk of the tactical Army
        Nike Hercules sites engaged in
        continental air defense.

        Until now, they have manned
        all such sites on the American
        continent, although Guard units
        had charge of six Nike Hercules
        installations defending Hawaii.

        The Hawaiian units are not part
        of the Army command's task organization.

        The four Hercules batteries of
        the National Guard now a part
        of Washington-Baltimore defense
        are the first of 16 on-site National
        Guard Hercules batteries planned
        for use by the end of the current
        fiscal year next June.

        Dick said 20 more would be on
        sites by the end of the 1964 fiscal
        year. The program to convert
        Guard units from the older Nike
        Ajax missiles to the new Hercules
        will be completed by 1965.

        THE United States will
        lead the world into
        Space, said President
        Kennedy yesterday.

        Only if they occupied that
        position "can we help to
        decide whether this great
        new ocean will be a sea
        of blessed peace or a
        theatre of terrifying
        war," he went on.

        Speaking at Houston,
        Texas, he called for bold
        and daring efforts to
        land a man on the moon---a
        target he has set to
        be reached by 1970.

        ## Vowed

        He said: "We have vowed
        that Space shall not be
        governed by a hostile flag
        of conquest, but by a
        banner of peace.

        "Yet the vows of this
        nation can only be fulfilled
        if we are first---and
        we intend to be first."

        The President, who has
        been touring US rocket
        bases, was accompanied
        by Mr. Peter Thorneycroft,
        Britain's Defence
        Minister, when he visited
        Huntsville, Alabama, and
        Cape Canaveral, Florida.

        # SPARROW SUCCESS

        By Our Defence Correspondent

        A Sparrow 3 guided missile fired
        by an American naval plane has
        scored a head-on hit on a Regulus
        2 missile launched from the surface.
        The interception, according to the
        U.S. Navy, was carried out above
        the Pacific missile range off Point
        Mugu, California.

        Sparrow 3 is an air-to-air
        missile, and in this case was fired
        from an F-4H Phantom 2 jet fighter
        at supersonic speed. The Regulus
        missile, which it hit, was also flying
        above the speed of sound.

        According to the Bureau of
        Naval Weapons the head-on hit
        "destroyed the target missile".
        Details of the speeds and altitude
        have not been divulged.

        The F-4H can carry up to six
        Sparrow missiles, which are produced
        by the Raytheon Corporation.

        SUNNYVALE, Calif. (UPI) ---
        Eight of America's nine new astronauts
        have completed a four-day
        nationwide tour of space plants
        with an inspection of the Agena-D
        rocket that will play an important
        role in the U.S effort to
        reach the moon.

        Before they toured the Lockheed
        Space and Missiles Division
        plant where the Agena-D is assembled,
        the astronauts received
        a full briefing on the rocket from
        company and space agency officials.

        Included in the party were Maj
        Frank Borman, Lt Charles Conrad,
        Lt Cmdr James Lovell, Capt James
        A. McDevitt, Elliott M. See, Capt
        Thomas P. Stafford, Maj Edward
        H. White and Lt Cmdr John W.
        Young. The ninth astronaut, Neil
        Armstrong, did not take part in
        the tour.

        Elmer P. Wheaton, vice-president
        of Lockheed's space program division,
        explained that the Agena-D
        will "lock on" with the two-man
        Gemini capsule in space and will
        provide the power to put the capsule
        into orbit for an ultimate goal
        of 14 days.

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- The
        Army's director of aviation said
        he was "mad as hell" that there
        was no Army aviator among the
        U.S. astronauts.

        Brig Gen Delk M. Oden smiled
        when he said it and did not elaborate.

        But other sources indicated two
        Army candidates had been proposed
        for the manned space flight
        program but were not considered
        to have enough jet-flying hours to
        qualify as astronauts.

        Newsmen asked Oden about the
        astronauts at the annual meeting
        of the Army Aviation Association
        of America, which is comprised of
        Army fliers and industrial concerns
        which produce aviation equipment
        for the Army.

        At the meeting, Gen Earle G.
        Wheeler, new Army chief of staff,
        presented Distinguished Flying
        Crosses to three Army helicopter
        pilots who set new flight records.

        They were: Lt Col Leland F.
        Wilhelm, a Dunbar, Neb., native
        now assigned to Ft. Rucker, Ala.,
        who on April 14, set a record by
        flying his turbine powered Iroquois
        helicopter to a height of
        9,843 feet in two minutes, 17.3 seconds.

        Maj Boyce B. Buckner, Pike
        View, Ky., also assigned to Ft.
        Rucker, who on April 13 set a
        climb record of five minutes, 51
        seconds in reaching 19,686 feet.

        Maj William F. Gurley, a Washington,
        D.C. native assigned to Ft.
        Rucker, who set a speed record of
        134.9 miles an hour over a 621.4-mile
        closed course April 20. The
        record was previously held by a
        Russian helicopter.

        PLANS to build a bomber or civil airliner capable of
        flying at more than 15,000 m.p.h. at 250,000ft will be
        put before Mr. Fraser, Air Minister, this week.

        Dr. Barnes Wallis, inventor of the dam buster bombs,
        has drawn up the plans for the Vickers Aircraft Co. Dr.
        Wallis's new invention is for an aircraft capable of
        manœuvrable flight at 25 times the speed of sound. As an
        airliner it could reach San
        Francisco in about 30 minutes
        and Australia in 45 minutes.

        Vickers has a Government contract
        to examine the problems of
        variable geometry, or movable
        wings, but is now in a position to
        produce such a plane.

        Dr Wallis's new invention
        depends entirely on the successful
        application of movable wings. So
        the building of this exploratary
        machine is a vital step to producing
        the bomber or airliner.

        ## SKYBOLT REPLACEMENT

        ## Immune to defences

        Primarily the plans are for a
        bomber to replace Skybolt, the airborne
        nuclear ballistic missile due
        in the R.A.F. in 1965. Because
        Skybolt is airborne, and its location
        would be changing continually,
        it will be undefeatable for the next
        decade or more.

        But Dr. Wallis's plane, capable
        of orbiting the earth at will, using
        small airstrips, and with unheard
        of manœuvrability, will allow
        Britain's deterrent to be effective
        into the distant future.

        Dispersal possibilities, allowing
        it to be based anywhere in
        the world, would make the plane
        impossible to locate and destroy.
        Its speed, height and manœuvrability
        would keep it immune from
        any predicted defence system.

        PITTSBURGH (AP) --- A specialist
        in rocket fuels said cosmonauts
        of the Soviet Union will
        beat U.S. astronauts to the moon.

        The prediction was made during
        an interview by V. H. B. Whilihite
        of Ogden, Utah, director of
        technical operations for Thiokol
        Chemical Corp. a developer of solid
        fuels. U.S. space chief James E.
        Webb had earlier predicted Americans
        would get to the moon first.

        ## We'd Be Ahead

        "If America had invested solid
        fuel rockets eight years ago,"
        Whilihite said, "we'd have beaten
        the Russians into space. We would
        have orbited the first satellite and
        would now be close to landing a
        man on the moon."

        "The Russians are ahead of us
        because they started earlier and
        their leaders thought bigger," he
        said. "There's not a chance in God's
        earth of the U.S. beating the Russians
        to the moon. We just don't
        have the booster capability."

        ## In Six Months

        He predicted that Russia will orbit
        two men in one capsule within
        six months.

        Whilihite was here to speak at a
        solid fuels conference sponsored by
        the American Institute of Mining,
        Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers
        and the American Society
        of Mechanical Engineers.

        A COMMONWEALTH satellite communications system
        is, I learn, being actively considered by the British
        Space Development Company, the organisation which hopes
        to exploit the use of space commercially. It contemplates a
        number of satellites orbiting round the poles and the system
        could be placed in action within the next two or three
        years.

        This differs radically from Government scientists' plan to have
        12 satellites in equatorial orbit, timed to appear at a given place
        at the same time day and night, and designed to give world-wide
        coverage. This proposal was
        made known in London last
        week.

        The private system has the advantage
        that it would be easier
        to place in orbit and would probably
        be in working order up to
        three years before the official one.

        Improvements in space communication,
        however, are so rapid
        that such a system could become
        obsolete in a few years. After
        that the official plan would have
        all the advantages.

        Details of the official plan were
        given at the international conference
        on satellite communication,
        organised by the Institution of
        Electrical Engineers in London,
        which continues until next Wednesday.
        The plan was devised by
        the G.P.O. and the Royal Aircraft
        Establishment, Farnborough.

        ## 9,000 miles away

        It would involve 12 stabilised
        satellites on a circular equatorial
        orbit operating nearly 9,000 miles
        from earth. The satellites would go
        round the earth three times each
        day, but because of the rotation of
        the earth each satellite would
        appear at a given point every 12
        hours.

        The alternative, which had been
        considered, was a synchronous
        satellite, which appears to remain
        stationary from earth, but in fact
        orbits the earth at a distance of
        22,300 miles in exactly 24 hours.

        In either case new launching sites
        on or near the equator might be
        necessary to achieve the required
        accuracy of orbit. But for the eight-hour
        orbit a smaller launching
        vehicle would be necessary.

        The British Space Development
        Company is the private enterprise
        section of British space aspirations.
        Founded last February, it was sponsored
        by a number of leading
        industrial companies, including
        Associated Electrical Industries;
        Associated Television; Decca
        Radar; Hawker Siddeley Aviation,
        and Rolls-Royce.

        Its object was then described as
        "to bring together a representative
        cross-section of that part of
        industry which is interested in the
        development and exploitation of
        space for commercial purposes."

        If it attempts a polar orbit system
        it would be able to use any
        launching site in the world, and at
        the same time substantially smaller
        launch vehicles since, presumably,
        smaller orbits would be contemplated.

        Synchronous and semi-synchronous
        orbits are not possible on a
        polar route because the earth spins
        beneath the orbit at right-angles
        to its path.

        What would be required would
        be more complex ground stations
        since accurate telemetry would at
        all times be essential. Three simultaneous
        orbits, each involving a
        number of satellites, would be
        necessary to ensure complete coverage
        and the satellites would be followed
        in the same way as Telstar.

        The great advantage is that such
        a system could be established using
        knowledge and rockets which are
        at present available.

        ## Telstar limitations

        All these systems have considerable
        advantages over Telstar, particularly
        the G.P.O.-R.A.E. plan.
        Telstar is by way of being a
        demonstration piece.

        It "wanders" in the same way
        as the moon does, and although
        its time of coming to any one place
        can be calculated up to nine days
        in advance, the period between
        passes is irregular. Its orbit is low
        and highly elliptical so that its
        signal range is limited and
        variable.

        In fairness to the Americans
        their Relay and Synchrom systems
        of communication satellites are
        being developed under pressure.
        Both involve circular equatorial
        orbits and it seems likely that the
        Americans are tending to favour
        the idea of a synchronous orbit.

        The British official plan is a
        compromise in terms of possible
        launching vehicles and the difficulties
        of keeping a synchronous
        satellite on station.

        But space engineers and scientists
        are in a highly optimistic
        mood. Capt. C. G. Booth is in
        charge of the satellite communications
        project for the G.P.O.

        THE first Russian or American returning
        from a moon trip might bring on his
        clothes or his boots, lethal germs for which the
        world has no antidote, a space medicine expert
        told the international astronautical congress
        here today.

        Professor Carl-Johan
        Clemedson, of Sweden,
        said scientists already
        have evidence of the most
        deadly bug known on
        earth probably existing on
        the planets.

        This is botulinus toxin,
        eight ounces of which could
        wipe out the world's population.

        The professor, head of the
        department of hygiene at
        Gothenburg University, warned
        the 500 scientists here that
        they are paying too little attention
        to the dangers of letting
        loose on the world a wildcat
        germ.

        ## Tetanus

        Studies of the atmosphere on
        Mars had shown botulinus
        germs could grow there and
        probably do. Other germs
        which thrive in atmospheres
        with little oxygen, such as
        Venus, could also develop.

        He listed dozens of these
        germs, including tetanus and
        anthrax. In earthly form
        these were dangerous enough
        but from outer space they
        would be even more lethal because
        radiation and the different
        environment would have
        changed their character.

        This would make it difficult,
        if not impossible, to fight them
        with drugs or vaccines.

        The professor added: "In
        Sweden we have set up a special
        laboratory where we can duplicate
        conditions on the moon or
        Mars.

        ## Polluted

        "We are subjecting certain
        germs to radioactivity and
        different temperatures to see if
        they alter in any dangerous way.
        But I believe we should do much
        more to solve this and the other
        problems thrown up by manned
        space flights."

        There was also the problem of
        keeping the moon and planets
        free from the earth's microbes.
        If the solar system were polluted
        with earth germs scientists
        would never be able to understand
        how the planets developed
        their life forms.

        ## Minuteman Electronics

        Los Angeles---USAF is evaluating industry
        proposals in a competition for
        USAF/Boeing Wing 5 and follow-on
        Minuteman ICBM ground electronic system.

        The system will evolve both cable and
        radio techniques for data processing,
        communications, and systems support
        required to monitor, control, and launch
        the missile. Decision in the competition
        is due next month.

        Electrical connection between control
        center and missile in the first four
        programed Minuteman wings has been
        by cable only.

        NEW YORK, Friday.

        THE American Air Force's
        X-15 rocket plane rolled
        over and the nose gear collapsed
        in an emergency landing
        on the dry bed of Mud
        Lake, Nevada, to-day. The
        engine was unable to develop
        enough power after a drop
        from 45,000ft.

        The pilot, Major John McKay, 39,
        was conscious when he was taken
        from the plane. But he had been
        trapped upside down as ammonia
        fumes seeped into the cockpit. A
        helicopter was instructed to hover
        overhead to blow the fumes away
        while he was cut out of his seat
        straps.

        Officials said he was "smiling
        and talking" as he was moved to
        hospital at Edwards' Air Force
        Base, California. He has a suspected
        fractured hip and superficial
        injuries.

        It was the first really serious mishap
        to the X-15, which holds the
        world altitude and speed records
        of 314,750ft and 4,104 miles an
        hour. It was Major McKay's seventh
        flight in the plane.

        In to-day's flight, one of a series
        of experiments, the plane dropped
        from 45,000ft.

        Major McKay jettisoned his fuel
        and spiralled towards the emergency
        strip at Mud Lake.

        RUSSIA has now nuclear
        submarines fitted with
        350-mile range ballistic
        missiles. Although the existence
        of such submarines has
        been suspected for some time,
        Western naval intelligence
        officers have now confirmed
        that "a number" of them are
        in commission based in the
        Kola Inlet in the White Sea.

        The Russian submarine fleet has
        again been reduced, by the scrapping
        of older boats, from last year's
        total of 430 to 400, with more than
        10 of them nuclear-powered. Some
        may now be able to launch at
        short range ballistic missiles from
        under water, but most have to
        come to an awash position to use
        three vertical launching tubes in
        conning towers.

        ## AMERICAN RANGE

        The American Polaris submarine-launched
        missile has a
        range of 1,800 miles, but by summer
        next year its range will have
        been increased to about 2,500 miles.
        This is likely to be the maximum
        range of which the missile will be
        capable.

        Some Russian patrol craft as well
        as cruisers and destroyers are now
        fitted with surface-to-surface as
        well as surface-to-air missiles. This
        is the first indication that small
        ships are being equipped with
        missiles.

        THE Army wants Treasury
        consent to place a multimillion
        pound order for a new
        American "pocket" anti-missile
        missile, the Mauler.
        This is the only weapon in
        sight to meet the Army's desperate
        need for an up-to-date
        defence against low-flying aircraft
        and artillery rockets.

        The first move would be to
        order just enough Maulers to get
        Britain "in the queue." But as
        Rhine Army aims at enough logistic
        backing to fight a 30-day war,
        it is clear that ultimately this means
        spending at least £30 million in
        dollars on around 1,000 missiles.

        At present, the Army's only low-level
        defence is the virtually
        obsolete 40 mm. Bofors, an improved
        version of the gun with
        which it started the last war. Its
        British-designed replacement, the
        PT 428 missile, was scrapped in
        February.

        ## Saving to taxpayer

        It would have cost £40 million
        to £50 million in research and
        development alone. It is claimed
        that buying from America
        would be cheaper because the
        British taxpayer would not have
        to pay for the initial cost of
        developing the Mauler, on which
        nearly 40 million dollars has so
        far been spent.

        But the cancellation of the PT 428
        was one of a series of hammer-blows
        which have been dealt out
        to the British missile industry,
        culminating in the recent decision
        to dispense with Blue Water.
        Details of its latest offering, the
        anti-aircraft Tigercat, will be
        announced at Farnborough this
        week.

        Its makers, Shorts, hope that the
        Army will buy it and thus encourage
        sales to N.A.T.O. This would
        boost employment hopes at the
        firm's factories in Northern Ireland.

        ## The only weapon

        But what the generals really want
        is a weapon which can operate by
        day or night and in all weather
        against any low-flying aircraft or
        tactical enemy missile in its area.

        The PT 428 was largely designed
        for this rôle, so is the Mauler. It
        is still in the development stage
        and cannot be in service for
        another two or three years, but
        even so, it is the only weapon of
        its kind anywhere on the stocks.

        The Army has a powerful claim.
        It is now a case of either the
        Mauler or nothing.

        This is one more example of the
        Army's staggering deficiencies in its
        ability to meet emergencies.

        WASHINGTON (UPI) --- President
        Kennedy has named 13 prominent
        Americans to set up this
        country's new space-age satellite
        communications corporation.

        They will set up the private
        corporation, which will be under
        government regulation, and make
        plans for the initial public stock
        offering.

        Press Secretary Pierre Salinger
        said the incorporators will not be
        paid by the government. They
        could vote themselves daily fees
        while engaged in setting up the
        first satellite corporation, he said.

        All stock in the corporation will
        be owned by individuals and by
        such corporations as American
        Telephone and Telegraph and the
        Radio Corporation of America. But
        the government will control the
        firm's formation and will have a
        permanent voice in its operations.

        The President will keep the
        corporation under review.

        Named to set up the corporation
        were Edgar F. Kaiser, 53, officer
        of Kaiser Industries, Lafayette,
        Calif.; David M. Kennedy, 57,
        Chicago, chairman of board and
        chief executive of the National
        Bank and Trust Co.; Philip L.
        Graham, publisher of the Washington
        Post and Times Herald; Sydney
        Weinberg, director of several companies,
        including the Continental
        Can Co., General Electric Co., Ford
        Motor Co., F. B. Goodrich Co. and
        Van Raalte Co.

        Also Bruce G. Sundlun, 40, partner
        in the law firm of Amram
        Hahn and Sundlun in Washington;
        A. Byrne L. Litschgi, 42, partner
        in the law firm of Coles, Himpes
        and Litschgi, Tampa, Fla.; Beardsley
        Graham, president of Spindletop
        Research Inc., Lexington, Ky.;
        Leonard Woodcock, 51, vice-president
        of United Automobile, Aircraft
        and Agricultural Workers of
        America, Grosse Point Park, Mich.;
        Sam Harris, 50, with the law firm
        of Strasser, Speigelberg, Fried and
        Frank, New York City; George J.
        Seldman, 58, legal counsel and
        member of the board of directors
        of Mastan Co., Inc., as well as
        practicing law in Boston, Washington
        and New York.

        Also Leonard H. Marks, Washington,
        D.C., lawyer and partner
        in firm of Cohn and Marks; John
        T. Connor, president of Merck and
        Co., Rahway, N.J. and George L.

        A MODEL of a manned
        spacecraft is being tested
        in wind tunnels by the Royal
        Aircraft Establishment.

        The design, I understand, is intended
        to form the basis of a
        manned vehicle. It could travel
        through the atmosphere, manoeuvre
        in space and return to the ground.

        Mr. Amery, Minister of Aviation,
        referred to such a manned spacecraft
        last night. He was speaking
        at the Society of British Aircraft
        Constructors' dinner in London on
        the occasion of the Farnborough
        Air Show.

        He did not mention any of the
        practical work. But referring to
        the European Launcher Development
        Organisation, he said he
        thought it would be a mistake to
        think of space only in terms of
        satellites and boosters.

        ## MINISTRY STUDY

        ## "Opportunities beckon"

        He added that the Ministry were
        already studying the feasibility and
        implications of such a craft.

        "I cannot forecast what the conclusions
        of this study will be or
        what judgment the Government as
        a whole may pass on them, but the
        industry should bear this possibility
        in mind."

        Mr. Amery added that the opportunities
        of space beckoned with a
        golden finger. Three questions
        were "How far could we afford to
        pursue them? How far could we
        afford to neglect them? What path
        should we follow?"

        "The answers lie mostly in the
        future, but I for one am convinced
        that Britain will have to get into
        space."

        There was speculation at the Air
        Show that Dr. Barnes Wallis, the
        British Aircraft Corporation designer,
        is engaged on the design of
        a manned space craft. But there
        was no confirmation. Dr. Wallis
        designed the "dam buster's"
        bomb and the Swallow, the variable
        geometry aircraft.

        Sir Roy Dobson, speaking at the
        same dinner, attacked the Govern-

        The new "oval" telescope for
        Jodrell Bank, work on the site of
        which has just started, is to
        cost £65,000 more than was
        originally estimated. The new
        estimate is £301,000. Although
        construction has been delayed, it
        is still expected to be finished
        about the middle of next year.

        The new telescope will have an
        oval reflector dish 125 feet by 83
        feet, supported at the ends of its
        longest diameter. The pedestal and
        mounting for the dish are almost
        identical with those of the Goonhilly
        Telstar aerial, which was designed
        by the same engineer, Mr
        H. C. Husband.

        The increased estimate is due,
        according to a Ministry of Works
        spokesman, to a general increase
        of 10 per cent. in civil engineering
        costs since last year, to some parts
        let on fixed price contracts working
        out more expensive than expected
        (especially the computer, which is
        to cost an additional £13,000) and
        to a number of improvements in
        design.

        ## Costs criticism

        The increases will give some
        satisfaction to the Department of
        Scientific and Industrial Research
        which was severely criticised for
        overspending on the first Jodrell
        Bank radio-telescope.

        As a result of this criticism, the
        D.S.I.R. now employs expert
        departments, such as the Ministry
        of Works, to handle its large contracts.
        For this service, the
        Ministry of Works charges 15 per
        cent. on the gross sum involved,
        or exactly two and a half times the
        standard fee of the consulting engineers
        employed on the project.

        PRESIDENT KENNEDY aims to put an American
        on the moon by 1970. Since Russia has already
        sent a camera satellite round the moon, the propulsion
        problems can obviously be mastered.
        American and Russian scientists have sustained
        human life in the thin outer envelope of the earth's
        atmosphere, and with Cdr. COUSTEAU setting up a
        villa under the sea, some kind of "prefab" for moon
        wardens is conceivable. What practical uses will
        result? A Russian Nobel prizewinner has suggested
        that the moon could become a site for nuclear power
        stations harnessed to the earth. In theory, anything
        is possible. It would be instructive to see first
        whether man could survive on its surface long
        enough to make the pioneer surveys for a moon
        colony.

        There is much of absorbing interest to be
        learned from fossil specimens of the plant and other
        life that existed before it became separated from
        the earth. Man will probably lead a cramped
        existence for years, comparable with Adml. BYRD'S
        hutment life at the South Pole, or camp life near
        the summit of Everest. Mr. KENNEDY'S proposition
        is feasible. Questions in doubt are which nationality
        will land there first and whether the moon can
        provide scope for man's restless energies. After
        hoisting on it a flag of resistant fibres, and
        fixing his cosmic instruments, man may end by
        leaving it again, like the many peaks and wastes
        that he has "conquered" on earth.

        DOES it pay to be in the space race? For the
        Soviet leaders as they look down on the wildly cheering
        crowds in Moscow this afternoon, or as they read
        their telegrams of congratulation, the answer can
        only be that it most certainly does. Whether the
        good people of Moscow, as they wend their way
        home past understocked and overcrowded shops,
        will continue to feel quite the same way about it is
        perhaps questionable. But that the Americans are
        prepared to spend £10,000m. to complete their
        Apollo project, to put a man on the moon by 1968,
        is proof enough, if proof is needed, that the two
        Governments at least hold very much the same view.

        Moreover, it is not just the Russians and the
        Americans who are in the space business on a
        national basis. The French, the Italians and the
        West Germans are all planning their own projects,
        even if on a smaller scale. It is only when one comes
        to Britain that a different picture emerges. Both
        Britain's main space interests, the Anglo-American
        satellite programme and the European Launcher
        Development Organisation, which plans to make use
        of Blue Streak, are essentially international affairs.
        It is difficult to judge whether this position has been
        reached by design or accident. There is certainly
        little to suggest that a firm hand has been guiding
        the evolution of our space policy to this point. But,
        now we are here, it would be encouraging to know
        in what direction and, more important, on what
        principles we are to proceed.

        It is arguable that the ideal course to take would
        be to press ahead with space development at a
        European level, although in close co-operation with
        the Americans, on a much more ambitious scale
        than hitherto. But is there a danger that while
        we pursue the ideal our European neighbours will
        calmly proceed with their national projects to the
        detriment of British technology? On the whole,
        fears of this kind are probably exaggerated. As long
        as we remain well and truly involved in various
        forms of space development, there is no particular
        reason why it should be confined within a purely
        national framework. If others care to pursue elusive
        national glory this way, let them. We have always
        been served better by hardheaded commonsense and
        co-operation wherever it pays.

        LIFE may have started, not on earth, but far out in space,
        and it may be older that the earth, Prof. J. D Bernal
        said at the British Association meeting last night. Academic
        as might appear the study of the origins of life, it could be of
        the greatest practical importance
        in making food for man of the
        future.

        The course of evolution may
        have taken longer than the time
        physicists would allow for the
        existence of the earth. Before the
        evolution of living creatures the
        fundamental materials of life, the
        enzyme which were the catalyst of
        life, must have evolved.

        In the beginning there must have
        been simpler materials than the
        complicated ones which seemed to
        have been stabilised in living creatures
        for millions of years.

        "If life pulled itself together
        from simple molecules it must have
        done it in a very simple way," Prof.
        Bernal continued. "If it is an easy
        thing to do, we should be able to
        do it ourselves." A start on this
        had already been made in laboratories
        by the production of certain
        fundamental materials.

        He was now slightly prejudiced
        against the view that meteorites
        contained fossils, which would be
        evidence of life in other parts of
        the universe. At one time he had
        been slightly in favour of it.

        The reason for his present view
        was that it was unlikely that life
        existed on the small asteroids
        between Mars and Jupiter, from
        which the meteorites most probably
        came.

        On the other hand, he could
        argue against himself "by pointing
        out that these small bodies might
        once have been hot because of
        radio-activity with a temperature
        ranging from 2,000deg. in the
        centre to the temperature of outer
        space on the outside.

        "Somewhere in between there
        would be the right temperature for
        life, between nought and 100deg.,"
        he added. "So in these places life
        might have existed on the ground."

        # Trapping Mars microbes

        BY A SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT

        A device that will throw out
        sticky strings to trap Martian
        life is proposed for Mariner B,
        the American spacecraft intended
        to land instruments on Mars
        during 1964. The strings will be
        wound back into the spacecraft
        and tested for microbial life.

        Life is considered more likely to
        exist on Mars than on any of the
        other planets. The life detector
        in Mariner B will be based on a
        radio-active tracer method. The
        two 50ft. strings ejected from the
        spacecraft will be impregnated
        with a nutrient broth containing
        radio-active carbon-14. Any microscopic
        forms of life adhering to
        the strings will turn some of the
        carbon-14 into radio-active carbon
        dioxide which will be detected
        with a Geiger counter after the
        strings have been reeled back into
        the spacecraft.

        Mariner B, will look for microscopic
        forms of life rather than
        larger organisms because if there is
        life on Mars these are likely to be
        far more abundant. It is also quite
        possible that bacterial life could
        exist without larger organisms, but
        larger organisms could hardly exist
        without bacteria.

        Conditions on Mars do not
        appear to be very favourable for
        life. The average temperature is
        well below freezing point, and the
        atmosphere, which is very thin,
        may contain no oxygen. But the
        United States Air Force had shown
        that some microscopic forms of
        terrestrial life can survive in simulated
        Martian conditions.

        Twenty unidentified satellites have been launched by the US
        Air Force since November. Among these have been six Samos
        reconnaissance satellites, one Midas missile warning satellite, and
        12 others containing Midas and Samos equipment. They have been
        launched under conditions of military secrecy.

        This information is given in an issue of "Flight" published
        today. It comes after the two Soviet spacemen had returned safely
        to earth.

        Major Nikolayev (64 orbits) and Colonel Popovich (48 orbits)
        landed yesterday within six minutes of each other south of Karaganda
        in Kazakhstan. Both were officially reported to be well. Tass
        stated that they had withstood excellently the conditions of being
        put into orbit, the long flight in space, and the return to earth.

        Sir Bernard Lovell, commenting at Jodrell Bank on the Russian
        achievement, said that she now had "a clear space superiority in
        the military, if not in the scientific, sense." The Soviet exploit
        "has added a new and agonising dimension to the world's troubles."

        VARNA (Bulgaria), Saturday,

        THE sign "Dangerous Radiation" is coming down
        from the threshold of space. Scientists no longer
        think that charged particles trapped in the earth's
        magnetic field will severely limit the activities of spacemen.

        A journey to the moon
        within the present decade
        thus becames much less of a
        thus becomes much less of a
        thought.

        This important change of
        mind, I learned here to-day,
        was brought about by Russia's
        Cosmos series of Sputniks
        which have been popped
        into orbit at regular intervals
        since last spring.

        The eight Sputniks have been
        carrying out a concentrated
        survey of conditions outside the
        atmosphere, some going deep
        into the extensive radiation
        belt called the Van Allen Belt,
        discovered by an early American
        space probe.

        ## CAREFUL

        ## Analysis

        Careful analysis of their
        findings, I understand, has
        satisfied the Russians that
        their manned spaceships can
        be adequately shielded without
        substantially adding to the
        weight.

        Indeed it was not until they
        were satisfied that Soviet
        scientists permitted Nikolayev
        and Popovich to make their
        long orbital flights last month
        although it was not expected
        they would encounter dense
        radiation.

        A scientist attending the 30-nations
        Space Travel Congress
        which ended here to-day told
        me that Academician V. I.
        Krassovsky, in charge of cosmos
        investigation, had given a
        personal guarantee that the
        two cosmonauts would not be
        harmed.

        JERUSALEM, Saturday.

        A COSTLY arms race has started in the Middle East following
        recent Russian deliveries to Egypt of jet bombers and
        the build-up of President Nasser's rocket force. Possession of
        these advanced weapons has upset the military power balance
        between Arabs and Israel and
        is creating growing tension.

        Mr. Shimon Peres, Israel's
        Deputy Defence Minister, and
        closest adviser to Mr. Ben
        Gurion, the Prime Minister, said
        to me in an interview in Jerusalem:
        "We are determined to
        establish an effective deterrent
        to meet this new threat."

        The decision to meet Egypt's
        challenge is a bitter blow for
        Israel's economy which is now hard
        pressed in trying to cope with a
        new flood of Jewish immigrants
        from North Africa. "There is only
        one person more depressed than I
        at this prospect and that is the
        Minister of Finance," Mr. Peres
        commented.

        ## Bitter over U.S. aid

        Israeli intelligence reports estimate
        that so far 14 Tupolev (TU16)
        600 m.p.h. jet bombers---similar to
        Britain's Valiants and with a bomb
        load of 10 tons---have been
        delivered to Egypt and more are
        on the way from Russia.

        They could be over Tel Aviv in
        less than 10 minutes and have far
        greater destructive capacity than
        the French Vautaur fighter bombers
        in service with the Israeli Air
        Force. Egypt has also recently
        received about 40 of Russia's latest
        MiG 21 jet fighters.

        The TU 16s backed up by MiG
        21s are considered by Israel to be
        a greater short-term danger than
        the Egyptian V2-type rockets with
        a range of about 300 miles which
        were fired last month. Israel is
        especially vulnerable to air attack
        with most of her population concentrated
        along the narrow coastal
        strip.

        The Israelis are bitter over
        America's growing economic aid to
        Egypt which, they assert, has
        helped Col. Nasser to divert his
        own funds to the expensive business
        of rocket production, assisted
        by highly-paid German experts.

        The Israeli Government proposes
        to make representations to the
        Federal German authorities to take
        a stronger line with West German
        rocket experts and technicians.
        These are believed to number more
        than 200, including Nazis.

        Israel has already embarked on
        an expensive programme of equipping
        its air force with France's
        latest fighter, Mirage 3---already
        understood to be in service. This
        fighter is considered more than a
        match for the MiG 21s and the
        Israel Air Force crews are known
        to be of a higher standard than the
        Egyptians.

        ## Plea to Britain

        America has refused all Israel's
        pleas for arms and Israel is now
        renewing her appeals to a reluctant
        Britain to sell her Bloodhound, the
        ground-to-air anti-aircraft anti-rocket
        missile. So far Israel's
        request for "Bloodhound" has
        been refused as Britain does not
        want the responsibility of introducing
        yet another new weapon into
        the Middle East arms appeal.

        Although Mr. Peres denied that
        Israel was building an atomic
        weapon at its secret nuclear
        station at Dimona, south of Beersheba,
        he said the Israeli deterrent
        should be sufficiently powerful and
        impressive to force the Arabs to
        hold back.

        There is considerable speculation,
        impossible to confirm in security-conscious
        Israel, that the Israelis
        are developing a rocket force of
        their own. Just over a year ago
        Israel launched a two-stage solid
        fuel "meteorological" rocket but
        no more mention has been made of
        it.

        # US TO TRY AGAIN

        By an Air Correspondent

        The second attempt by the United
        States to launch a spacecraft to the
        vicinity of the planet Venus is
        scheduled to be made from Cape
        Canaveral next week. The craft is
        known as Mariner 2 and will be
        launched by an Atlas Agena launch
        vehicle.

        The first Mariner spacecraft was
        destroyed in mid-air by the range
        safety officer at Cape Canaveral on
        July 22 when its rocket veered off
        course only five minutes after lift-off.
        The reason for the off-course swerve
        was later reported to have been the
        omission of a hyphen in the guidance
        equation which controlled the flight of
        the rocket vehicle.

        rocket-shot at Venus with the
        space "probe" Mariner Two.

        The shot was due next Monday,
        but yesterday scientists at
        Cape Canaveral were forced to
        delay it for "several days."

        The small Seacat anti-aircraft guided
        missile is about to enter service with
        the Royal Navy after a development
        programme of five years. The manufacturers,
        Short Brothers and Harland
        Ltd, announced yesterday that acceptance
        trials had been completed and
        that new export inquiries for the
        Seacats were still being received.
        Orders have already come from Germany,
        Sweden, Australia, and New
        Zealand.

        According to the statement, the
        Navy's fullscale firings of the missile
        have confirmed earlier research results
        on the best way to guide short-range
        missiles of this kind. These had
        demonstrated that a man was a better
        controller for the weapon after it was
        launched than the usual electronic
        equipment. Seacat is controlled by an
        aimer who trains his binoculars on to
        it and transmits radio instructions by
        moving a joystick.

        Seacats are the third line of defence
        for a naval task force. Fighters from
        carriers do long-range identification
        and interception, the large Seaslug
        beam-riding missiles will take the next
        stage when they reach service, and
        Seacats are the defender's final option.
        When small ships operate without
        carriers or guided missile destroyers,
        Seacat will be their only air defence.

        ONE of the nine new American astronauts who
        were named on Monday could be the first
        man on the moon. And if it is an American
        boot that makes the first imprint on the dusty surface
        of the dead planet, most of the credit will be due to
        a brilliant engineer named Dyer Brainerd Holmes.

        At 42 Holmes is the chief
        engineer of Apollo, the
        moon project, and he is
        pretty confident that he
        will land Americans on the
        moon and get them back
        safely by 1967 with luck,
        and certainly by 1970
        without luck.

        The programme will cost
        £7,000 million at least and
        perhaps £14,000 million
        (more than the entire British
        defence budget).

        ## SO BRIGHT

        HOLMES is acutely
        conscious of his responsibility
        but is not
        shaken by it. "No, my job
        doesn't frighten me. I am not
        bright enough."

        Actually Holmes is so bright
        that he is dazzling. He is
        probably the free world's most
        brilliant engineer.

        He toys with a rocket-shaped
        china piggy bank on
        his desk and says: "This is
        to keep me thinking about
        the tax-payers' money."

        Holmes emphasises people
        rather than machines. He is
        in charge of tens of thousands
        of employees and says: "In
        the last analysis it will be men
        who do the job."

        President Kennedy hired
        Holmes last November. He
        sees the President regularly.
        In ten months of intense
        activity the Brooklyn-born
        Holmes has performed
        prodigies.

        When he took over the
        moon plan seemed lagging
        and disorganised and today
        there are still scoffers as distinguished
        as Dwight Eisenhower
        who call the plan madness.
        But Holmes is unperturbed.

        ## SO TOUGH

        HE says: "When a
        great nation is faced
        with a technological
        challenge it has to
        accept or go backwards. Space
        is the future of man and the
        U.S. must keep ahead."

        His massive job gives him
        pleasure and pride although
        he gave up a position with the
        Radio Corporation of America
        which was netting him about
        £25,000 a year for the space
        job which brings him only
        £7,000 a year.

        Money doesn't mean much
        to Holmes, nor to his wife,
        Dorothy, and their two
        daughters, another Dorothy,
        17, and Katherine, 13, who
        live in a little house in
        Washington.

        One of their few luxuries is
        a sail boat called the Flying
        Scot and every Sunday Holmes
        and his family go racing in
        Chesapeake Bay.

        Holmes keeps fit with
        physical exercises every morning
        before leaving for work.
        He looks fit, a tough 5ft. 10in.
        tall, weighing just over 12st.

        The moon man could pass
        as a business man in the City.
        He always wears dark, conservative
        suits, uses horn-rimmed
        glasses when reading,
        and his short-cropped brown
        hair is touched with grey.

        He is without boast or
        swagger, but he was pleased
        with an article in the New
        York Times which said:
        "Wanted---a strong man to do
        a $20,000 million job that may
        take till 1970. Must have
        impeccable references, dogged
        devotion to duty, sharp eye
        for detail, and intolerance for
        anything less than perfection."

        Holmes got the job. He has
        all the qualifications.

        # VENUS ATTEMPT POSTPONED

        ## ROCKET FAULT

        From Our Own Correspondent
        NEW YORK, Sunday.

        A new attempt will be made tomorrow
        morning to launch a
        Mariner space craft to the vicinity
        of the planet Venus. The space
        craft was to have been launched
        to-day, but trouble developed in
        the Atlas-Agenda rocket last night
        during the count-down.

        A spokesman for the National
        Aeronautics and Space Administration
        said the problem was not
        serious. He declined to give
        details.

        NEW YORK, Wednesday.

        PRESIDENT KENNEDY declared to-day that America's
        lead in the world's drive into space was so vital that
        no effort must be spared in the interests of peace and
        security. He demanded a "bold, daring and unflinching
        effort to land a man on the moon before 1970."

        Speaking at Rice University, Houston, on the second day of
        his tour of space centres, he made it clear that he regarded the
        effort to make the United States the world's leading spacefaring
        nation as among the most important
        during his term of office.

        Mr. Kennedy said: "We cannot
        shrink from it now." Although
        America was behind Russia in
        manned flight there was no intention
        of staying there.

        The President referred to "the
        nation's conscience," which required
        the effort to fulfil its obligations
        as a first-class country.
        "Whether space science will
        become a force for good or evil,"
        he declared, "is up to men to say.

        "Only if the United States occupies
        a position of pre-eminence can
        we help decide whether this great
        new ocean will be a sea of blessed
        peace or a terrifying theatre of
        war."

        ## PLEDGE ON SPENDING

        Mr. Kennedy gave this promise
        to critics of the space programme
        on the grounds of cost: "The
        Government will invest money only
        when greater returns were guaranteed.
        Space expenditures will soon
        rise---from forty cents (2s 10d) to
        more than fifty cents (3s 7d) per
        week for every man woman and
        child."

        The President said that about
        40 satellites which had circled the
        earth were made in the United
        States and were "far more sophisticated
        and supplied far more knowledge
        to the people of the world
        than those of the Soviet Union."

        Mr. Kennedy made his significant
        speech appropriately in Houston,
        the manned spacecraft centre from
        which the rocket to the moon will
        be launched.

        WASHINGTON, Wednesday.

        AMERICA still hopes to
        beat Russia to the Moon,
        said Mr. James Webb, head of
        the National Aeronautics and
        Space Administration, at a
        Press conference to-day.

        Mr. Webb was asked to comment
        on Sir Bernard Lovell's statement
        that the chance of America
        catching up with Russia in the
        next decade was remote. He said:
        "We have under way a large,
        on-going, fast-paced programme."
        It would bring results.

        "I think we will make a manned
        lunar landing and return before
        the Russians," he said. His deputy,
        Dr. Dryden, said America had seen
        no evidence that Russia had
        developed a booster rocket of the
        power required.

        America is developing a rocket
        called Saturn C-5 which will produce
        7,500,000lb of thrust in its
        first stage. It will not be ready
        until 1965.

        ## 7,500,000lb THRUST

        ## Rocket plan for 1965

        It is at that stage that America
        hopes to catch up and overtake
        Russia. In the meantime, Mr.
        Webb conceded that Russia would
        continue to lead.

        "The Russian flights have
        demonstrated a very real technological
        capacity," he said. It
        was probable that Russians would
        be the first to make manned
        journeys round the Moon.

        Other spokesmen contended
        that a higher degree of accuracy
        would be needed for a manned
        flight to the Moon. "The guidance
        problem for a Moon shot has not
        yet been solved by anybody so far
        as we know," one official said.
